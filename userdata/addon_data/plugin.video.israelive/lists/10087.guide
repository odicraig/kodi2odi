American painter Alice Neel was an extraordinary and prolific figurative painter, and yet she spent most of her life working in obscurity, struggling as a single mother to survive. Born in 1900, Neel portrayed the 20th century until her death in 1984. She painted the people around her, on the margins of society, as well as her own hard, complicated and sometimes broken life. So many of her own traumas were compounded by her uncompromising need to paint: 'I had to paint', she said, and always at great personal cost. Made by Alice's grandson Andrew Neel, imagine reveals a complex and captivating woman, weaving home movie footage and candid interviews with family and friends. It is honest, at times upsetting and yet ultimately inspiring."}, {"start": 1488846600, "image": "https://static.filmon.com/assets/tvguide/image%2F592081%2F2%2F592081-TheGraham-12989127791/poster-350x152.jpg", "end": 1488849300, "name": "The Graham Norton Show", "description": "A compilation of highlights from the current series featuring a host of star guests, including Justin Timberlake, Tom Hanks, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dame Helen Mirren, Tom Cruise, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling."}, {"start": 1488849300, "image": "https://static.filmon.com/assets/tvguide/image%2F6443%2F2%2F6443-BBCNews-13727763840/poster-350x196.jpg", "end": 1488866400, "name": "BBC News", "description": "BBC One joins the BBC's rolling news channel for a night of news, with bulletins on the hour and the headlines every 15 minutes."}, {"start": 1488866400, "image": "https://static.filmon.com/assets/tvguide/image%2F37691%2F2%2F1372741200-37691-Breakfast-13727781460/poster-350x196.jpg", "end": 1488878100, "name": "Breakfast", "description": "The latest news, sport, business and weather from the BBC's Breakfast team."}, {"start": 1488878100, "image": "https://static.filmon.com/assets/tvguide/image%2F985099%2F2%2F985099-TheHousin-14097401060/poster-350x196.jpg", "end": 1488880800, "name": "The Housing Enforcers", "description": "Consumer programme.

Jenny visits a sleep charity in Doncaster that gets up to 200 emails a day from desperate parents. She meets Jayne, mum to a toddler who takes up to four hours to go to sleep, and follows them as they trial a firmer bedtime routine. At Honley High School in Yorkshire, Jenny investigates how poor sleep is affecting pupils' concentration and behaviour in class.

For the maintenance teams, this means working through the night to get the bridge off the carriageway."}, {"start": 1488916800, "image": null, "end": 1488920400, "name": "The Secret Chef", "description": "Four-part series that sees Britain's worst cooks transformed into culinary masters.
