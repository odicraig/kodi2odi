			<emu_comment>Vectrex List by Zach Morris, filtered to remove duplicates and games not many people actually want to play.[CR]The Vectrex is a vector display-based home video game console that was developed by Western Technologies/Smith Engineering. It was licensed and distributed first by General Consumer Electronics (GCE), and then by Milton Bradley Company after its purchase of GCE. Unlike other non-portable video game consoles, which connected to televisions and rendered raster graphics, the Vectrex has an integrated vector monitor which displays vector graphics. The Vectrex is monochrome and uses plastic screen overlays to simulate color and various static graphics and decorations. At the time, many of the most popular arcade games used vector displays, and through a licensing deal with Cinematronics, GCE was able to produce high-quality versions of arcade games such as Space Wars and Armor Attack.[CR]Developer:  Western Technologies[CR]Manufacturer:  General Consumer Electronics[CR]CPU:  Motorola 68A09 @ 1.5 MHz[CR]Memory:  1 kB (two 4-bit 2114 chips)[CR]Graphics:  MOS 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA)[CR]Sound:  General Instrument AY-3-8912[CR]Display:  Vector CRT[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max Controllers:  2</emu_comment>

				<title_clean>Armor Attack</title_clean>
				<plot>In Armor Attack, players control a jeep that can fire directly forward. Tanks and helicopters appear on-screen and players earn points by shooting them, with each target usually taking multiple shots to damage and eventually destroy. Jeeps explode after one hit, forcing players to duck and cover behind buildings or use the jeep's superior speed to avoid getting hit.  Armor Attack is a vector graphics game and, in arcades, the walls of the buildings that create the maze-like level upon which the entire game is set aren't drawn on-screen. Instead, a plastic overlay is placed over the screen that contains the buildsing and other features. Without this film, it's impossible to know where the walls of the maze are, making the game effectively impossible to play.  Shooting down helicopters increases the number of points earned for shooting tanks.  Armor Attack was later ported to the Vectrex console, which also required the use of an overlay. The vertically oriented screen on the Vectrex also meant that a new maze had to be designed.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Berzerk is a multi-directional shooter game requiring players to navigate mazes filled with enemy robots. This was one of the first video games to use speech synthesis, featuring robots that talked.The game also features an infamously bizarre variation of a pressured-on-time element. Occasionally a yellow smiley face called " Evil Otto" would appear and feverishly roam about the mazes in attempt to catch the player, while destroying robots standing it his way.[CR]Other Versions[CR]In addition to the arcade original and the popular Atari 2600 version (1982), Berzerk was also ported by General Consumer Electronics for the Vectrex in 1982, and by Atari to the Atari 5200 in 1983. Stern Electronics made one sequel to the game titled Frenzy, which was only in arcades and ported to the ColecoVision.[CR]Deaths Associated with Berzerk[CR]In 1981, Berzerk became an early example of death by playing a video game. After attaining a score of 1660, a 19 year old named Jeff Dailey died from a heart attack. The very next year, another player named Peter Burkowski also died from a heart attack. This happened shortly after he achieved two high scores within a fifteen minute time span. He was 18 years old.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Clean Sweep replaces the ghosts from Pac-man with bank robbers and you play as the bank's manager. After the robbers blew your bank to smithereens, you must collect all the money with your trusty vacuum. As you are collecting the money your vacuum begins to fill, expanding until full. (Holding up to 32 "bills") Once full you must return the money to the vault. (Center, highlighted yellow by the Vectrex overlay) As time passes the robbers will continue to spawn (Maps start with 1 robber and go up to 4) and they will also get anxious and begin to get faster. At the 4 corners of the board there are "special rooms", that when entered your vacuum becomes supercharged. While supercharged, your vacuum will hold infinite money and also suck up the robbers themselves. Also while supercharged you cannot deposit money into the vault, any money collected during the charge can never be deposited into bank and does not add to the size of the vacuum. The supercharge lasts only 10 seconds. After all the money is retrieved, the board flashes and resets the game to the beginning while keeping track of score.     Scoring 1 Bill/Money collected = 10 points1 Bill/Money returned to vault = 20 pointsFull Vacuum load returned = 640 pointsSupercharging = 50 pointsRobber eaten = 100 points If robbers are eaten consecutively with same supercharge, scoring is doubled with each robber (i.e. 4 robbers eaten with same charge, 1st robber = 100 points, 2nd robber = 200 points, 3rd robber = 400 points, 4th robber = 800 points) [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Cosmic Chasm</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] - Vectrex[CR]In Cosmic Chasm the player assumes the role of a ship armed with a bomb, tasked with destroying the Cosmic Chasm space station. The game is divided into a series of individual rooms that are connected by a series of corridors. Inside each room, the player must contend with a set of diamond shaped enemies and a rapidly expanding central core. The player is also given the choice in each room which exit to take in order to pick the best possible route to the station's central core. Once the core has been reached, the player must deposit the bomb at the center, and then trace their steps back through the rooms to the exit before the bomb detonates.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] - Vectrex[CR]The map screen.The player's ship is armed with a set of lasers; a front mounted drill; a single bomb; and a limited use shield. The lasers are used (of course) to destroy the enemies that populate each of the rooms in the level map. In cases where the enemies swarm the player too quickly, the shield can be used to deflect them for a limited amount of time. The drill is used to open the various exits in each of the rooms by carefully placing the front mounted drill over-top of the forcefield and firing. The bomb is only used in the central room on the map, and is deposited at the core which triggers the end-level scenario.The rooms in Cosmic Chasm are all very similar in their design. They all contain a certain number of enemies that home in on the player's position and try to collide. They also all contain a central core that quickly expands to fill the room. The state of the rooms is saved once the player exits, so care must be taken in order to ensure that a safe pathway is being left to escape through. The main difference between rooms are the number of exits, which correspond to the map screen.The map was fairly simple in its design, and changed each time a new mission was loaded. Sometimes the player is blessed with only having to traverse a few rooms in order to reach the core, while at other times the route is much more complicated. Once the bomb is placed in the center room, the player only has about 15 seconds to exit the station before it explodes; speed is essential in this game.Vectrex colour overlay.The graphics in Cosmic Chasm are fairly straightforward in their design, but perfectly effective for the platform at the time. As the Vectrex only contained a grey monochrome screen as a default, each of the games usually came with a plastic colour overlay that would slide into some slots at the top and base of the screen to hold it in place. This allowed the player data (score/zone) to be differentiated by the colour blue from the main game area which is red. The base of the overlay also showed a representation of the controls as they laid out on the Vectrex controller and its four buttons.The enemy and ship design is also very simple. The enemies are solely made up of small diamond shaped objects that a randomly spread across each room. The enemies attack by attempting to collide with the player. As soon as your ship enters the arena, the enemies immediately begin to home in on the player position. The speed at which this happens increases with the difficulty level.Standard game screen.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>As far as Vectrex games go, the holy grail for many collectors and gamers is the unreleased flight simulator, Mail Plane. This quirky take on the tried and tested genre made use of the obscure light-pen accessory to control the airborne vehicle tasking you with delivering letters. Unfortunately nobody got to experience this unique offering back in the day following the games cancellation.[CR]Having said that, the moment many of these deprived gamers had been waiting for finally arrived in November - a Mail Plane prototype cartridge surfaced on eBay in Pennsylvania, United States. Selling for a massive $877, one lucky bidder had finally secured the chance to experience this oddity once and for all, however, they had bigger plans for this title.[CR]Understanding the demand for this long lost title, AtariAge user Vectrexer - the new owner of this Mail Plane prototype - decided to generously create a ROM image of the game cartridge and release it online for free to the masses.[CR]As of today we can all finally experience Mail Plane in its original form, although there are a few more issues present. Not only do we need a Vectrex flash cartridge to load the ROM on to, but also the incredibly difficult to source Light Pen accessory.</plot>

				<plot>Unveiled at the Summer '82 CES in Chicago, the Vectrex is a stand-alone arcade system that uses vector (line) graphics instead of the usual raster or pixel images. Mine Storm, a game very similar to the Arcade version of Asteroids, is built in to this portable machine. In this game, transport lanes of intergalactic space have been seeded with mines from an alien vessel. You control a mine-destroying blaster that rotates on an axis and can fly and shoot in all directions (including off-screen) across the non-scrolling, star-studded playfield. Your job is to blast everything out of the sky so you can progress to the next level.There are four types of mines which appear at different stages of the game. Floating Mines, which are shaped like three-pointed stars, simply drift through space. Fireball Mines, which look like four-pointed, semi-square stars with a dot in the middle, hurl a fireball at you when you shoot them. Magnetic Mines, which resemble four-pointed stars, will follow you wherever you go. Magnetic-Fireball Mines share traits of both Magnetic and Fireball Mines.As you progress through the 13 mine fields in Mine Storm, the combinations of mines get more complex and harder to defeat. If you can somehow make it through the 13 stages, you will enter a new type of universe. Space dust and new aliens add more action and challenge to this new world.</plot>

				<plot>The goal in Narrow Escape is to successfully navigate a ship through the narrow, fast-moving passages of the warlord's fortress, destroy the defense forces and avoid space debris. The player's ship must also be maneuvered through small holes in a series of walls where fuel cells can be picked up to restore the ship's constantly decreasing fuel supply. If the player pilots their ship successfully, they will be faced with the warlord's own escape ship which must be hit several times to be destroyed, liberating the star system from the warlord's tyranny.[CR]Each level becomes more difficult as everything will move faster, fuel will be consumed more quickly, the holes in the walls will become smaller, and more menacing defense forces will appear.[CR]Each level of game play consists of two phases:[CR]1. Passages: During the first phase of each level, the player must maneuver their ship through the narrow, moving passages with the joystick while shooting six of the warlord's defense forces with button 4. If any of the six are missed, they will go off-screen and be recycled to give the player another chance, but more fuel will be used. In addition to various defense forces which must be destroyed, there are extra targets that can be shot for additional points. Unlike the regular defense forces, the extra targets are non-threatening in that they will not shoot or crash into the player's ship. During this phase, space debris will also be shooting up through the play field. Space debris cannot be shot and can only be avoided by dodging it by moving from side to side. The walls of the narrow passage are also a danger to the player. If the player's ship crashes into a wall, a life will be lost. There are gaps between the moving walls which the player can maneuver quickly into and out of so as to avoid approaching enemies or space debris, however as game play becomes faster this will present a higher risk to crashing into oncoming walls.[CR]2. Walls: If the passages are successfully navigated and the the required six defense forces are destroyed, the player will enter the second phase. This is a series of walls with holes. In the first level of the game, there are five successive walls, each with one hole through which the player must maneuver their ship. In the second level of play, there will be six successive walls, in the third level, seven walls, etc. Also the size of the holes will become smaller in each new level. The hole will be in a different location on each wall. After passing through the hole in each wall (but prior to entering the hole in the next wall) there will be a fuel cell which must be passed to pick up. If the fuel cells are missed, the game will continue, but the fuel gauge will be continuously depleting. Note: in early levels of the game, all of the fuel cells will not need to be captured. However as the game progresses and fuel is consumed faster, all of the fuel cells will need to be captured in order to make it through the next level.[CR]After successfully completing three levels of play, the player will come face-to-face with the warlord's escape ship in open space. The warlord's ship must be shot five times to be destroyed during the first encounter, seven times on the next encounter, nine times the next, etc. The warlord's ship will shoot torpedoes at the player's ship, which can be either avoided or shot at to be destroyed. If the warlord's escape ship is destroyed, the player will enter the next level of play and the game will continue.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pole Position was an arcade game released in 1982, developed by Namco. The game is seen as revolutionary for its popularization of sprite based, pseudo-3D graphics. It was one of the first games to use the "rear-view racer format" that would change the way in which racing games were developed. Pole Position was also one of the first games to feature in-game advertising. It was also the first ever 16-bit video game, utilizing two 16/32-bit Zilog Z8002 processors.When looking for a publisher in the United States, Namco originally approached Midway with a choice between two games, Pole Position or Mappy. Midway chose Mappy and Namco turned to Atari to publish the game. Midway would miss out on a large opportunity as Pole Position became one of the most popular arcade games of 80s and was ported to an assortment of different consoles. The game even spawned its own Saturday morning cartoon show on CBS. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>Rip Off is based on the classic Cinematronics vector graphics coin-op game. This game challenges you to guard a quantity of fuel cells from scavaging space pirates.The game begins with four or eight fuel cells located in the middle of the screen. The pirates attack in waves of two or three ships. You must use your spaceship to shoot down the pirates before they can link up with a fuel cell and tow it off the screen. The game ends when all your fuel cells have been ripped off.As the game progresses, the pirates become faster and more deadly. Some of the pirate ships are armed with lasers, others will deliberately ram you. Fortunately, Rip Off allows cooperative two-player play so you can enlist the aid of a friend when the going gets tough.</plot>

				<title_clean>Scramble</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Scramble is a side-scrolling shooter originally developed by Konami for the arcade. The game predates Gradius, and shares many qualities with that classic franchise.Scramble is a side-scrolling shooter with forced scrolling. It was the first scrolling shooter to offer multiple, distinct levels. The game is thus credited with setting the template for most of the side-scrolling shooters that followed its release.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Scramble's second stageScramble is a horizontal shooter played using a four-way joystick and two buttons that control the forward guns and bombs. The game has six stages, and in each stage the player must navigate a gauntlet of enemies. The environment is also a considerable hazard as the terrain can be difficult to navigate with the slow ship. Additionally, the ship is constantly running out of fuel, and must refuel on the fly by destroying fuel tanks that litter the stages. The final stage requires the player to finish a tricky bombing run, which if they fail, they must repeat the stage. After finishing the last level, the game loops back to the first stage and plays again at a higher difficulty level where the ship runs out of fuel more quickly.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Arcade flyerScramble was ported to many different home game systems and computers, both legally and as illegal clones. It was the subject of an important intellectual property case (Stern Electronics, Inc. v. Kaufman, 669 F.2d 852) where it was ruled that Stern Electronics Inc. (the game's publisher in North America) could copyright the images and sounds in a game and not just the game's source code.Sequels and Relation To GradiusThe arcade game Super Cobra could be called a sequel to Scramble, as it shares basically the same game mechanic as the original. Scramble is also cited as a predecessor to Gradius in both the introduction to Gradius Galaxies on the Game Boy Advance and the Gradius Breakdown bonus DVD included with Gradius V; however, Konami disputed the relation in their guide for the Gradius Portable collection on PSP. Although Scramble may now not be part of the official Gradius continuum, it's easy to see how some of the features of Scramble, such as independently-fired weapons and hazardous terrain, were further developed for Gradius.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Space Wars is based on the classic Cinematronics vector graphics coin-op game of the same name. This is a one-on-one duel between a pair of hostile space ships. A single player may take on the computer or two opponents can compete head to head.Each ship starts with a limited amount of energy for lasers and thrust. A ship may be damaged by a glancing blow or completely destroyed by a direct hit. Once a ship is destroyed, the player who destroyed it receives one point and the battle starts again with both ships fully refuelled. The game ends when one player has scored ten points.Seven different game variations are available. These can be used to adjust the speed of the ships and lasers. The game variations also affect the gravitational pull of the sun in the center of the screen.</plot>

				<plot>[CR] Gameplay: [CR] During gameplay the cannon located in the center of the screen would "track" your ship and occasionally shoot a large energy blast at you which you needed to avoid.  As you would shoot the outer "ring", pieces would disappear, if you totally destroyed every "piece" of a ring, the ring would regenerate completely.  The object was to create "holes" in all three rings in which you could make a timed. well-aimed shot at the center cannon.  Some ring "parts" held "sparks" that once the part was shot, the spark would release and slowly chase your ship around the screen.  You could fly off the screen in any direction and instantly "warp" to the opposite side, also like Asteroids.     [CR]Graphics: [CR] As was typical with Vector Graphic games of the time (Asteroids, Rip Off, etc.) there was no "color" other than the white vectors, so to add color to this game's screen a colored film was applied to every cabinet.       Controls:  Star Castle's controls were similar to Asteroids.  They consisted of: Rotate LeftRotate RightThrustFire[CR]</plot>

				<plot>This text refers to the Atari Video Computer System version of this title.Make a journey into space in with Star Ship, one of the original nine titles released for the Atari 2600. Choose between flying a spaceship through the cosmos and shooting down enemy ships, or piloting a lunar lander. The first four games are variations of Star Ship for one player. You play for two minutes and 16 seconds and try to destroy as many star fighters, flying saucers and space robots as you can. They move faster or slower depending on which version you select and may appear one or two at a time.The next five variations are for two players. One player is in command of a star ship after the other player's space module. These variations last for four minutes and 32 seconds each, and at the halfway point the players switch ships.In the two Warp Drive games, which are for one player, the object is to cover as much distance as possible, while avoiding asteroids.Lunar Lander makes up the final set of games. The object is to simply land on the moon. In the two-player variation, one player controls the lander and the other controls the moon in order to prevent the lander from landing.Points are scored as follows: One point for a star fighter, two for a flying saucer, three for a space robot and two for the space module. Asteroids can't be destroyed.</plot>

				<plot>Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a first-person shooter set in the Star Trek universe. The player controls a ship equipped with photon torpedoes, trying to eliminate as many enemy ships as possible. After destroying a sufficient amount of enemies, the player advances to the next level.The screen has two status bars, one for the amount of torpedoes left, and one for the remaining shield. The shield is used to repel the star-shaped projectiles fired by enemy ships. Both bars can be replenished by docking with the space station that comes into view from time to time. It is also possible to warp into a black hole, where the player has to take on a Klingon mothership.</plot>
