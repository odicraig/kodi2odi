			<emu_comment>Apple 2GS List by Zach Morris, filtered to remove duplicates and games not many people actually want to play.[CR]The Apple IIgs is the fifth and most powerful model in the Apple II series of personal computers produced by Apple Computer. The "GS" in the name stands for Graphics and Sound, referring to its enhanced multimedia capabilities, especially its state-of-the-art sound and music synthesis, which greatly surpassed previous models of the line and most contemporary machines like the Macintosh and IBM PC.[CR]The machine is a radical departure from any previous Apple II, with its true 16-bit architecture, increased processing speed, direct access to megabytes of RAM, wavetable synthesis music synthesizer, graphical user interface, and mouse. While still maintaining full backwards compatibility with earlier Apple II models, it blended the Apple II and aspects of Macintosh technology into one. Keeping with Apple's *Apple II Forever* slogan of the time, the IIgs set forth a promising future and evolutionary advancement of the Apple II line, but Apple paid it relatively little attention as the company increasingly focused on the Macintosh platform.[CR]

				<plot>What's that coming over the hill, is it a monster? Yes, as this Rampage-influenced arcade game sees you play either an ogre or a dragon. Both are searching an island for an egg which will give them super powers. [CR]This is located inside a building, and to find the right one you must continuously smash them up, using either the ogre's horn or the dragon's tail. Humans must also be attacked as you see them, as their catapults weaken you. Food can be found to restore energy,[CR]Once you have located the egg, a one-on-one beat 'em up battle with your rival ensues - win five of these to finally win the game.</plot>

You will fight pirates and genies, find romance and heartbreak, comedy and tragedy.Sinbad and the Throne of the Falcon is a more action-oriented game than most other Cinemaware releases, though it still contains strategy portions in which the player has to tactically move troops around to secure victory. The game features many arcade and fighting sequences, as well as limited decision-making moments.</plot>

				<plot>You have been turned into a ball of air with a slow leak by an evil wizard. You must find the Spellbook and the ingredients for the spell. Without these, you will never turn back into a human again.[CR]These items have to be collected in the maze which consists of 150 isometric rooms. These can be explored freely but sometimes you need to have special objects to proceed, e.g. a candle in dark rooms. The dangers consist mostly of sharp objects which can cause your ball to burst. Additionally you are on a timer because your balloon loses air constantly. But it can be refilled by using pumps which can be found in the maze - but you have to leave them in time or you explode because of overpressure.</plot>

Upon arrival, Hunter soon realizes that all is not well on the space station Zekford.[CR]Zekford has been overrun with hostile aliens--the bodies of the research scientists lying strewn about the halls. Timothy must blast his way through the hordes of enemies and solve the puzzles contained in the data left in the station's central computer system in order stop the second alien from hatching and to save his friend.[CR]The game plays mostly as a top-down arcade shooter. The player must stay alive and interface with the various computer terminals throughout the level. These terminals provide the player with clues that allow the player to access new sections of the level. The clues come in the form of riddles that reference both the objects in the game and the back story contained in the game's manual.</plot>

				<plot>All About America is an educational game that teaches children American history and geography as well as the English language. It consists of two main activities: history lessons and map reading skills. Both of these can be played by one or two players.History lessons include 16 different stories about America's past. These can be played in any order and consists of two parts: one where the player gets to read and watch pictures of the subject and one quiz part based on the story. There are two question types: reading skills that tests what the player remembers from the story and vocabulary building that tests how well the player knows some of the words that appeared in the story. For both question types the player has three alternatives to choose from.When testing map reading skills there are three map types to choose from: the thirteen colonies, America before the civil war and the present United States. Like in the history activity the player can choose to look and learn or to do a quiz. For each map type there are different types of questions. For colonies there are only questions about the name of the colonies while for the civil war map there are both state names and postal codes and for present day USA there are also quizzes for capitals and compass directions. </plot>

				<plot>In this game, the player takes the role of Adol (Aron in the English-language Sega Master System version) Christin, a red-haired adventurer and expert swordsman. One day he encounter a fortune teller who sends him on a quest to find information about the six books of Ys. It appears that there was once an ancient land called Ys, whose secret was sealed in those six books. Before long Adol learns that the six books were all stolen by the evil wizard Dark Fact (Dulk Dekt in the Sega Master System version, Malificus in the English-language computer versions). It is Adol's task to defeat the villain and discover the secret of Ys!Ys: The Vanished Omens is an action role-playing game with its own trademark combat system: instead of pressing the "attack" button, the protagonist simply runs into the enemies he encounters. More damage is inflicted upon the enemies if Adol charges at them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in the hero's death if the monster is stronger than him. The player gains gold and experience points for defeating foes; once enough experience has been accumulated, Adol levels up and becomes stronger. The hero can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.</plot>

				<plot>Ancient Glory is a side scrolling action game based on Greek mythology. It is based on the adventures of Hercules who the player controls as he travels the Greek countryside (as well as some other locations in the Mediterranean) in his quest to defeat the gorgon Medusa. To do so five magical items have to be collected which is done by completing tasks for Hermes and Athena. At the same time Hercules has to be aware of the wrath of Hera, who will try to stop him. Time is limited as the player only has seventeen days of in-game time to complete the quest.The game starts out in Thebes with an unarmed Hercules who has to use his feet to kick at the scorpions that attack him. Weapons can be collected such as a club, a sword and a bow (which is given to Hercules by Athena when visiting Athens) which are needed to defeat animals such as lions, bulls and snakes as well as mythological creatures such as molionids and minotaurs. Levels are linear and involve moving from left to right but can be played in any order although locations that are farther away take a longer time to travel to. </plot>

				<plot>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.[CR]The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.[CR]By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Black Cauldron is a graphical adventure game that was released in 1986 by Sierra Entertainment for the PC and equivalents (such as the Amiga and the Apple II). The game was designed by Al Lowe, a veteran adventure game designer who was also responsible for the Leisure Suit Larry series, Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist, and Torin's Passage.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Unlike many other Sierra adventure games of the era, The Black Cauldron was based on a licensed property: a 1985 Disney animated film directed by Ted Berman and Richard Rich. The film itself, and to some degree the game, is based on The Chronicles of Prydain books, written by Lloyd Alexander. The Black Cauldron game's story revolves around pig herder Taran. When Taran's magical pig Hen Wen is kidnapped by the evil Horned King, Taran sets off to win his magic pig back.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Black Cauldron is notable for several reasons. First, the game features a dynamic storyline, with branching plots and multiple endings. Second, in order to make the game more accessible and easier to control, the designers eschewed the traditional text parser system in the favor of a function key system which mapped specific actions (Inventory, Look, Use, etc.) to a respective F-Key.[CR]</plot>

However, it is now 1989, and the Communist Block is crumbling...[CR]Chris Crawford, who rarely ever made a sequel to a computer game, was besieged by mail asking him to update his classic from a few years before to reflect the new state of the world. Russia was falling, the Iron Curtain was shattering, and smaller countries were beginning to assert their own regional power with more freedom from the bipolar world of the Cold War.[CR]The result was the 1990 Edition. This game featured an updated database, but the most significant new features were:[CR]1. The multipolar level, where small countries could go to war with their neighbors on their own. Of course, you could help them out (or encourage them!) by sending in military aid.[CR]18 more countries, bringing the total to 80.[CR]A "Crisis Advisory Board" of four people, who would give you advice during international crises.

				<title_clean>The Bard's Tale II - The Destiny Knight</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]   Taking place following the events of the first   Bard's Tale, the party that is presumably the same that had saved the city of Skara Brae receives a desperate letter from a mage called Saradon who implores them to come to his aid. An evil and powerful archmage named Lagoth Zanta and his hordes threaten the cities of the Realm and it is his hope that the player's party will be able to stop him. But the only relic that could unite the cities and give the party the power to stop his invasion has been shattered. The fabled Destiny Wand that has maintained seven centuries of peace is gone and with it, the hopes of an entire land. However, Saradon has managed to discover where the pieces of the wand lay hidden. Broken into seven pieces and hidden within seven deadly Snares of Death throughout the land, the party is challenged to reforge the Destiny Wand, call upon the powers of the Destiny Knight, and ultimately confront and destroy Lagoth Zanta. The players begin their quest in Tangramayne, the capital city of the Realm, a land where six other cities lay scattered across a large, open wilderness. From there, they must gather the clues needed to unravel the locations of several other dungeons, each containing a vital clue to lead the party on to their next destination. There are no cinematics within the game to help tell the story, although there are occasionally small events in the form of text that help describe some of the key elements within the game. The Snares of Death, in particular, had "magic mouths" which would present their challenges in the form of riddles filled with the clues needed to survive each one. The hint guide, bearing the title "Dream Quest", for the game was particularly noteworthy for its narrative approach in guiding the player. Taking on the form of a fictional story centered around a party of adventurers that sought the services of an old wizard and his young apprentice, they would embark on a "vision quest" into the possibilities offered to them of a quest for a certain "golden fleece" or that of the Destiny Wand. The young apprentice would invisibly accompany the party into the vision and the journal that he would carry would magically write itself with their experiences and his own thoughts creating the story journal. The hint guide was illustrated with artistic sketches alongside maps and would describe the ending of the game as well as that of its own story.[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]   Players must assemble a band of adventurers and track down the seven pieces of the Destiny Wand to confront and defeat the evil Archmage, Lagoth Zanta. Once all seven pieces are recovered, the scepter must be reforged, unifying the Realm and winning the game.The Destiny Knight is the sequel to the first Bard's Tale as initially released on personal computers such as the Apple and the Commodore 64. According to the box text, it features various improvements over the original system such as:50% larger than the first Bard's Tale Six new cities and an overland wilderness The ability to summon and name monsters to become a permanent part of your party Ranged combat A bank and a casino  Six cities expanded the scope of the adventure acting more as locations for specific dungeons than as living, breathing, politically driven entities. They are:Tangramayne Ephesus Philippi Colosse Corinth Thessalonica  The game continues to use the   grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90&#176; turns and movement spaces. Within the persistent interface, a small window on the upper left quadrant of the screen displayed the world as in the first with the party listed below and a text box in the upper right quadrant of the screen displaying messages and encounter options. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes which would now use ranged attacks.Destiny Knight was also notable for its use of an open wilderness between the six cities of the Realm, the land in which the story takes place. Predating similar efforts such as that found in Bethesda's   Elder Scrolls series by several years, the wilderness contained several dungeon areas that were necessary to complete for the main quest.   Puzzles were also given a high priority this time around in the form of Death Snares, trap rooms in which the pieces of the Destiny Wand were hidden and which could kill the entire party if they failed to solve it within a certain time limit. A rough map was included with the game showing the locations for several places but leaving the mapping of each interior to the graph paper tablets RPGers at the time used often to keep from getting lost.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   Beginners were given a break in the form of a pre-made party that they can use to jump right into the game with. The adventure starts at the Adventurer's Guild, a location in each city where the player can save the game, form their party, and save their characters to disk just in case the worst happens. Across from the initial Guild is a starter dungeon which should get them up to speed on both the game systems as well as toughen their characters up for the trials ahead. The manual suggests that the characters should reach level 14 before venturing anywhere else in the game.As with most RPGs of this type, party setup and character selection were left entirely up to the player. A party is limited to seven characters, although the manual suggests leaving one slot open for summoned monsters or special encounters that may occasionally join the party. This was particularly important within one of the dungeons of the game as a particular NPC would be required to help solve a puzzle.Time also plays a factor in the game as it cycles from day to night, night bringing out the more dangerous creatures that roam the Wilderness.Veterans can transfer character data from the first   Bard's Tale,   Wizardry I, or   Ultima III if they want to start off with a solid group of characters, although items and the like are not brought over.The game did not make use of an outside license for its statistics and rules, although it shared many similarities with TSR's Dungeons and Dragons ruleset with significant differences that set it apart. In particular, mages were not required to maintain a memorized "pool" of spells as in D&amp;D and instead cast their spells by using spell points which represented their inner strength and power. The types of spells that any one mage could cast were also dramatically different, although a character's   general statistics would reflect some of the traditional mentality that TSR's influence over RPGs at the time had made an impression with. RacesSeven races are available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new character and a party of seven adventurers with which to go out and save the world.  Human: As in most RPGs, their statistics and abilities are fairly average across the board with no distinctive bonuses. Elf: Fair haired, fair skinned, and more agile than humans, their specialities are focused on both magic and war although they tend to do better as spellcasters.   Dwarf: Short, gruff, and strong if not very smart, dwarves excel as solid warriors in the Bard's Tale.   Hobbit: Small, nimble, and wise, they make ideal rogues. Half-Elf: Thanks to their mixed ancestry, they are able performers as fighters although not as good as spellcasting as their elven peers. Half-Orc: Part human, all ugly, they also make decent fighters but offer no other significant bonus other than variety to the party.   Gnome: Resemble dwarves but are better at using magic. If you are looking for a little toughness to go with your mages, this is one race to consider.   Classes   Picking a class for a new character is one of the important decisions that the player will make in a game like this one. Using a combination of different skills is the key to building a solid party that will be able to return home and sing of their adventures. On the party screen, characters are represented by their name and abbreviated class for quick reference along with all of the requisite attributes such as   hit points (HIT PTS) and  Spell Points (SPL PTS) in  columns and lines.Warrior (WA): The consummate fighter, they can use nearly every weapon that they find. For every four levels of experience after the first, they gain the ability to dish out an extra attack. Paladin (PA): These are fighters dedicated to smiting evil wherever it may be. They can perform multiple attacks at higher levels, use most any weapon including certain ones that other fighters can't, and have a greater resistance to evil magic. Unlike in other systems, such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the player does not have to pick a deity for them to worship nor can they cast any spells of their own at higher levels. They are a pure fighter with bonuses making them a staple of any party in the Bard's Tale.  Rogue (RO): The professional thieves of the Realm, what they lack in fighting ability they make up for being sneaky. They can hide in shadows (thus avoiding damage from enemies) and are able to search for and disarm traps of which there are many especially within the Death Snares. Bard (BA): They are warriors that have learned to sing. Although they don't have multiple attacks at higher levels as a true warrior class would, their songs are capable of spell-like effects that can aid the party in a variety of ways. Unlike spell casters, the Bard's songs bestow important buffs on the entire party for the duration of the song. Their songs can often work even within anti-magic zones. If combat interrupts a song, it will pick up again when it is completed even if another song is performed during the fight. An instrument is needed for a Bard in addition to whatever weapons they have. The Bard can play as many tunes in his repertoire until his throat dries, thus necessitating a visit to the local tavern for a tankard of fine ale to get them going again. Hunter (HU): They can use most weapons and have the ability to often instantly kill an opponent by striking a vital nerve center, an ability that improves as they gain experience levels. Monk (MO): They use traditional fighting weapons and gain more effectiveness at fighting with their bare hands at higher levels becoming devastating warriors.   Magic users were divided into several classes with a few of these requiring a pre-requisite in ability. Mages had to meet those requirements before graduating to the higher classes which are initially unavailable to a starting party. It was also a one-way class change. Once a character chose to be a particular class, they were locked into that decision and could not learn any spells that they chose not to.Conjurers (CO): One of the first classes that a magic user can start with. They can create fireballs and compasses to help defend and guide the party and have a smattering of healing spells for support. Magicians (MA): This is another class that new magic users can start off with. They can enchant items with temporary effects and user their spells as buffs to aid the party in combat, such as improving their armor class. Sorcerors (SO): They can create illusions including illusory party members and aid in the perception of the world around the party with spells enabling them to see in the dark. Most of their offensive spells tend to be mind based. These are not initially available to new characters until they have earned three levels of experience as either a Conjurer or a Magician. In other words, if a Magician character class has leveled far enough to cast third level spells, they can become a Sorceror. Wizard (WI): As with the Sorceror, a mage must learn at least three spell levels of their starting class before they can become a Wizard. Wizards are the summoning specialists and have the ability to raise the dead making them extremely valuable. Archmage (AR): This class can only be attained after learning three spell levels from each of the preceding classes, although the manual suggests that a true Archmage is one that has learned all seven from each. Archmages have the smallest number of spells to choose from, but make up for this thanks to the sheer power vested within each one. They are able to heal an entire party, resurrect multiple characters at once, crush enemies with incredible magic, and summon powerful allies. Lagoth Zanta, the main antagonist of the game, is an Archmage.   Locations   There are a variety of locales in the game that provide a number of important services, listed both in the manual and within the game itself:The Sage: He lives out in the Wilderness and is a valuable treasure trove of knowledge. The player must make use of his services in order to ask for the location of certain places to which he will point the way, but only for a price. As the player journeys through the world, they will encounter new clues that they must barter with the Sage on in order to continue the quest, entering certain key words into the parser that comes up when conversing with him. Temples: Provide valuable healing services for when your mages aren't powerful enough yet to do the healing themselves. They are also the only places tha can cure withered characters (old age) or ones that have been turned to stone. The manual says that the resurrected character may need to sell their soul in order to come back to life, but in terms of the game, that doesn't happen. Roscoe's Energy Emporium: Roscoe is a mage who had opened a chain of energy emporiums in order to cash in on the sorcereal energy crisis of '27. Even after it had passed, Roscoe's emporiums continue to provide a valuable service by recharging the spell points of wealthy mages. His services don't come cheap, but if you can't wait for spell points to regenerate, his emporiums are worth a visit. Unmarked Buildings: While exploring the cities of the Realm, the player can barge into unmarked buildings. This also tends to trigger a combat encounter. For the most part, there is nothing to see in any of these structures except the exit, although the party will be running into several of these in searching for hidden dungeon entrances leading to the next part of their quest. Adventurer's Guild: This is the "union hall" where unemployed characters hang around hoping to join the next expedition. This is where it all begins and one is located in each of the major cities. Saves are handled here along with party formation. You can't save while in the middle of a dungeon or out in the wilderness, so knowing where these are located in each city is an important part of the game. You can also remove characters from your party and keep them here in case you need to free up an extra slot for a special character. One or two puzzles require the use of a special character in the party. Garth's Equipment Shoppe: Garth retired from adventuring and his deeds are sung far and wide. He now sells his knowledge of weapons and artifacts as a part of a string of stores that lie spread across the Realm, providing basic equipment to everyone as well as a few particularly rare and powerful pieces for those with enough gold. He can also identify unknown items thanks to his extensive knowledge, for a price, Selling rare items to Garth will not appear in his shoppe, though, so be careful about getting rid of items that you might need later on. Fortunately, quest items cannot be sold. Garth is everywhere and in every shoppe, so you don't need to worry about trekking back to one particular branch. Review Board: Shadowy figures representing all of the classes in the game sit in judgement over characters that come to them for advancement. If you have enough experience, you'll get your level. Mages learn their spells in batches, so once they gain a spell level, all spells in that tier are learned. These are not marked on any map and must be discovered. The good news is that they typically have a unique facade so turning and facing a building is all that is needed to know what it is. Casinos: Players can gamble their ill gotten gold in these halls for the chance to score big, although the dealers have been known to cheat if stiffed for a tip. Bedder's Bank for the Bold: An old-half elf who had reputedly sold his own mother to a band of lonely orcs to finance his first branch, Bedder will deposit your gold for safekeeping in case anything...tragic...happens to the party. There's no interest and withdrawals must be made for the entire amount, but gold can be added at any time in any amount. Good for making sure that there's a nest egg out there available for any set of characters that you might create.  Taverns: The rest stop for the Bard in your party and a place to hear pieces of gossip.  There were also the seven major dungeons that could only be found with the help of the Sage scattered throughout the Realm. Each dungeon would consist of several levels and sometimes possessed a   boss fight or two in addition to the Death Snare within. They would take the form of tombs, crypts, castles, and even a tower. [CR]Combat[CR]   Fighting in the game is handled through random encounters and is required to earn those valuable   experience points and grow the party into an unstoppable force capable of facing the dangers ahead. A list of foes (broken down by the number in each group) is given at the start of the fight. The maximum number of foes is up to four groups of monsters. Any group of monsters within 10' (feet) of your party are within melee range. Some monsters, however, will also use ranged attacks such as breath weapons or spells to deal damage, or summon monsters to block your advance. Combat is divided into a series of rounds and it is up to the player to decide what they should do next.Party arrangement is also important. The first four characters can be physically attacked and can dish out the same leaving the last three to resort to ranged attacks.Combat actions are triggered by hitting the appropriate key when a character's turn comes up, allowing the player to time certain attacks for when it is a particular character's turn to act in that round. They are:(A)ttack foes: Orders a character to physically assault the enemy. This applies to the first four chraacters only. (P)arty attack: Orders a character to beat down a fellow party member or special character. Sometimes necessary. (D)efend: This reduces the damage a character may recieve in case you suspect that they can do nothing else at the moment. (U)se an Item: Allows a character to use a ranged weapon or a magic item. (B)ard Song: Tells the Bard to play a short tune during the fight. Typically lasts for only one round. (C)ast a Spell: This is where mages get to work their magic. When selected, the player must enter the four digit code for the spell in question and specify a target if required. (H)ide in Shadows: Tells a rogue to hide in the shadows, avoiding damage during that turn since the enemy can't see them. They can also avoid spell effects this way.  All of the results are calculated in the background. Certain statistics, such as dexterity and luck, determine who will strike first in a fight. The character in the first party slot is designated as the leader and the chance of running into danger is heavily determined by the statistics of that leader.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The small country town Skara Brae was enjoying a peaceful life, until an evil wizard known as Mangar the Dark appeared. Monsters have invaded the town, terrorizing its inhabitants. Mangar cast the spell of Eternal Winter on the surroundings, isolating Skara Brae from any possible help. Guards that were entrusted with the task of protecting the town have disappeared within one night. Only a party of brave adventurers can save Skara Brae and defeat Mangar. The Bard's Tale is a fantasy role-playing game similar to Wizardry games, with first-person exploration of pseudo-3D maze-like environments, and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies. Unlike early Wizardry installments, the town can be explored physically, and parts of the overworld are accessible as well. Several dungeons must be explored before the player can tackle the final quest.Six character classes are available when the player is prompted to create a party of six adventurers in the beginning of the game: Bard, Hunter, Monk, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior, Magician, and Conjurer. The last two can be promoted when specific conditions are met during gameplay. The bard class plays a special role, possessing magical songs that improves the party's performance in combat and are required to solve some of the game's puzzles.</plot>

				<plot>Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. [CR]The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels.

				<plot>Aimlessly wandering through the Southlands of Quendor, the hero of the game encounters the Implementors, powerful beings who warn him of a terrible danger: the Coconut of Quendor, the very embodiment of Magic, has been stolen by terrifying monsters known as Ur-Grue, said to be the spirits of fallen Implementors. The task is clear, but by no means easy: locate the Ur-Grue and return the Coconut of Quendor to its rightful owners!Beyond Zork: The Coconut of Quendor introduces a somewhat different gameplay system compared to the previous text adventures of the Zork series. Text-based interaction and puzzle-solving are still present; however, role-playing elements have been added to the mix. The player character has six attributes assigned to him: endurance, strength, dexterity, intelligence, compassion, and luck. These can be determined by the player at the beginning of the game, randomly chosen by the game, or provided as part of a pre-generated character. The attributes affect the outcome of combat, which occurs in certain locations. They can also be raised or lowered during the game by gaining experience, drinking and eating certain items, wearing accessories, or in another fashion (sometimes humorous - for example, intelligence will be lowered by typing in swear words). Many locations and objects in the game are randomly generated.</plot>

He discovers that he has been cloned and is transforming into a machine. To prevent this transformation, Captain Blood must search the galaxy to destroy five other clones which contain bodily fluids. The gameplay is from a first person perspective and has music from French electronic composer Jean-Michel Jarre.GameplayThe game uses an icon based alphabet which is used to speak to aliens while traveling the galaxy. The interface is used to gain trust and information as to the location of other planets. The game takes place on Blood's ship, called The Ark. Part of the gameplay involves navigating worlds and traveling to other planets via the co-ordinates obtained from other aliens.As the game progresses, Blood's health decreases and causes the on screen cursor to shake, making the game harder to play. This could be remedied by finding Blood's clones.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Club Backgammon is a computer adaptation of the board game that can be played by two human players or by one human against three levels of AI. It's also possible to watch a game between two AI controlled players. The game follows the rules of the original board game and is played with a cursor that is used to click on the board to move around pieces and to throw the dices.Some additional options exist to customize the game such as editing the colors of board, pieces and dices as well as lowering the speed. It is also possible to turn on manual roll which means the player is allowed to enter his own dice values. Another feature is the possibility to see an evaluation of a player's position. This shows the number of points each player is away from bearing off, an evaluation of the blots that a player has showing and the number of moves the other player can make. A practice menu allows the player to edit the game board by moving the pieces into any legal position. There is also an option to reverse sides which means the player swaps pieces with the AI opponent. </plot>

				<plot>A mouse-driven game in which the player controls a small, circular spaceship which must travel around the screen collecting crystals. This task is made more difficult by the aliens which constantly swarm out from the portals on both sides of the screen. These can be shot down by the ship's gun (which has unlimited ammo) or eliminated by activating one of the player's limited supply of "smart bombs", which will clear the screen of all current enemies.[CR]The physics of the game were quite unusual for the time; the ship does not simply follow the mouse's movement like a mouse cursor. Rather, it retains its inertia, and must be carefully guided around so it does not crash into anything. Bullets, when fired, travel in the direction of the ship's movement, requiring the player to actually travel toward enemies in order to shoot them down.[CR]This was the first color game for the Macintosh, although it was business-as-usual for the IIgs.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dark Castle is the first game in the    Dark Castle series, and was released in 1986 for the   Macintosh. It was one of the first computer (or video) games to use fully recorded samples for      voices and sound effects, and although they were small in number the corresponding effects for yammering      mutants and dizzy  Prince Duncan were quite remarkable, especially when combined with the detailed backgrounds.The game starts with you - as Prince Duncan - entering the Black Knight's castle and the gate slams shuts behind you. In order to escape, you have to trek through      caves, dungeons, and a tower surrounded by perpetual lightning clouds before you're well equipped enough to take on the Black Knight himself.The game uses a WASD control scheme, lets you duck with Q and jump with the spacebar and aim and throw rocks with the mouse. There was a later Sega Genesis version that featured colour, but the horrific controls implemented for rock throwing almost made the game unplayable due to lack of accuracy. [CR]The Levels[CR] Great Hall Great HallOnce inside the castle you're presented with four exits - two doors on the left, a main double-door in the center and a narrow staircase up on the right side. Each is accessed by tapping the corresponding number key.The first two doors are arguably the most frustrating aspect of Dark Castle, since they're random. You have a 50% chance of exiting the side of the castle and embarking on your brief journey to earn      fireballs, and a 50% chance of getting throw down to the dungeon. DungeonUnfortunately, if you end up in the dungeon, the door locks behind you and you must trek through three screens, get the key, and trek back again, and you're no further ahead (alternatively you could just cheat and restart your game). Final area of dungeon (or first, if you fall in)You also end up in the dungeon if you fall into any of the game's pits - they are far fewer in number than in the original, though, as there are only two or three screens (of more than a dozen) that lead to the dungeon. Once there, you must      sneak up on the      torturer, whack him in the back of the head with a morning star, then leap over his unconcious body and grab the correct key before leaping back again. Time it wrong, grab the wrong key, or take too long and allow him to wake up again, and you're dead. Even if you do earn the key, you have to rock-throw, jump, and run your way back to the main hall again, resulting in an awful lot of painstaking      backtracking (in other words, don't fall in pits if you can help it).  Outer CastleIf you do get the correct door, you get to cross a small plain guarded by rock-throwing, gurgling mutants that constantly respawn and      climb three sets of ropes (allowing you to swap between them to avoid mutants climbing down at you). The following room has a number of moving platforms, requiring very careful jumping. It's the first area where use of the games' different jumps becomes essential - Prince Duncan jumps higher, lower, or longer depending on the direction you hold while tapping jump, and he cannot fall like      Mario. Falling more than twice his height will almost always result in death.Once past the platforming segment there is  a brief river rapids through dank tunnels and finally you meet up with the reclusive      wizard, who will gently anoint you with the gift of fireballs, allowing you to throw them instead of regular rocks. Of course, if you reach him without first obtaining the shield from the lightning tower, his magic spell will instead char you to a crisp. Lightning TowerThe left stairwell doesn't take you directly to the tower - where would be the challenge in that? Instead, the first room is a vague homage to      Donkey Kong, with rocks bouncing back and forth, descending level by level. Since Prince Duncan moves like the      Prince of Persia (that is to say, a bit more deliberate than your average Mario-esque platforming mascot) the best route is simply to sneak up ladder by ladder, pausing midway through for the next rock to bounce past. It is possible to duck under or jump over rocks, but this requires an awful lot of skill and patience.Getting hit by a rock while jumping or climbing near the left side of the level won't kill you like it will anywhere else - it'll send you down to the dungeon.The second screen pits you against divebombing vultures (all pattern based) and a firebreathing      dragon. Since your rocks are completely ineffective against the dragon, you have to climb the stairs and jump to the platform above him, dumping the pot of hot oil on his head in order to make him retreat back inside the tower.After hurrying into the hole left by the dragon, Duncan must navigate along a series of ropes and poles. The poles are distinguished by their solid colouring and are a very bad idea - shuffling over to a pole instead of a rope results in you slipping, which send you not to your death but, yes, the dungeon.The final portion of your task involves leaping diagonally up a series of disappearing platforms, which change in such a way that you must zigzag your way up and down and sideways in order to make it to the very top without dizzying yourself or cracking your skull open on the hard stone floor. The top of the room is the top of the tower itself, with a moving thundercloud that occasionally fires out a bolt of lightning. Avoiding that and grabbing the shield at the end will cause the cloud to home in on you, and you must activate the shield just before it zaps, warping you back to the great hall. Black Knight's SanctuaryThe double-doors in the center lead you to the Black Knight. It should be noted that the game never explicitly states that you need the shield and fireballs to complete the game, but it is physically impossible to navigate the rope/platform maze in the first room before you hear a loud barking/whooping noise.That noise is the gargoyle, who is immune to regular rocks and will fly over to you (wherever you are), pick you up, and toss you into the pit to the dungeon. The only way to kill him is to have the fireball upgrade, and that's the only way you're finishing that level.Once navigated past that you'll end up against the Black Knight himself, who sits in his throne in the middle of the room. There are four switches in each corner of the area that must be pulled in order to defeat him, and as you run and climb he'll toss beer mugs at you. These can be avoided, but it's much easier to just tap the shield button as they fly through you. It's a bit anticlimatic, but once all the switches are pulled, you complete the game and your high score is recorded on the main menu. [CR]The Enemies[CR] Enemies of Dark CastleThere are not many enemies in Dark Castle, but the ones that are present are quite distinct from one another.Altering the difficulty on the main menu changes the level completion bonuses you earn as well as the placement and number of enemies - it also affects how long certain enemies stay stunned when hit by your rocks. Needless to say, there will be many more (and less forgiving) enemies on advanced difficulty as opposed to beginner.  BatBats are probably the most common enemy in the game other than rats. When you enter a level they will be curled up at a particular point, sleeping, and will not awake for about five seconds. You can use that time to hit them from afar and smile to yourself as their lifeless corpse plummets to the ground with a splat, or you can wait for them to wake up and take advantage of a closer target as they fly towards you. They have no real pattern other than a general desire to fly straight towards you and kill you, which is a reasonable urge given Duncan's proficiency with rocks. RatRats are very uninteresting - they cannot kill you instantly, however, so you can touch one ever so briefly while running fast. Just don't linger, or they'll turn you stone cold dead. They have no pattern and simply wander back and forth on whatever ledge or floor they're on. Killing one starts a hidden timer, and after a while a new rat pops out of the appropriate rat hole and charges forth, so time the kills and your dashes well. GuardThe guards wander back and forth in much the same way as the rats - they're just bigger, invincible, and carry crossbows. The guards will only fire when facing you and while you're on the same level as them, although their crossbow bolts are subject to gravity and will lose a bit of altitude if you're all the way on the other side of the screen. Hitting them with a rock will make a thunderous tin can noise and knock them unconscious for about ten seconds, giving you time to sneak past. If you have fireballs, of course, you can kill them outright. Guards are only found in the dungeon. MutantMutants can throw rocks - not well, but they can throw rocks. They have a single, grotesque eyeball in the center of their bodies, massive hands, and yammer and gurgle unintelligibly while waving their arms and smacking their bottoms at you. Occasionally they stop this display in order to hurl a rock in your general direction. Mutants can also descend ropes, and (like rats) will respawn shortly after being killed, up to whatever number of mutants are supposed to be in a particular group. Burning EyeThe burning eye is a gigantic floating eyeball that is, well, on fire. It slowly glides in your direction and only stops when you hit it with a rock. Your reprieve is only temporary, however, and you'll have to stop your platforming occasionally in order to stun the eye before it gets too close to you. Of course, if you're lucky enough to have them, fireballs will drop the eye for good.  [CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]If you load Dark Castle when your system clock is set to Halloween (October 31st), a number of the enemies will be altered to fit the Halloween theme, such as pumpkin heads and candy. Similarly, when you set the system clock to Christmas (December 25), there is a Christmas tree in the foyer. The game also responds to setting the system clock to any Friday the 13th.The game also replaces the tilde (~) key with a castle icon, which you can use when entering high scores.Dark Castle for the Mac required a very specific (and streamlined) version of the Macintosh 7 operating system, requiring a boot diskette even for Macs with an internal hard drive. However, even with the game files and OS on the same disk it fit on a regular single density 3.5" floppy.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>D&#233;j&#224; Vu: A Nightmare Comes True!! is the first game made by ICOM, known for its adventure games such as Shadowgate and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based interactive fiction was the norm. In Deja Vu, action takes place in Chicago in December 1941. Your character's name is Theodore "Ace" Harding - a retired boxer working as a private eye. He wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who he is or what he is doing there. To make matters worse, you as him soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegetable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dungeon Master is a first person dungeon adventure from developer FTL (Faster than Light). The quest is to descend through 14 levels of the eponymous Dungeon to retrieve the Fire Staff - the only weapon capable of stopping the evil Lord Chaos.Dungeon Master was originally released on the Atari ST home computer in 1987. It was later ported to various other home computers of the era, such as the Amiga, the PC, the FM Towns, the Sharp X68000 and the Apple-II. It would eventually see console ports on the Super Nintendo and TurboGrafx-CD as well. Dungeon Master was eventually followed up with a far more challenging expansion pack, Chaos Strikes Back, as well as a sequel in 1994: Dungeon Master II: The Legend of Skullkeep.Dungeon Master was a trailblazing RPG in that it created the first truly real-time dungeon crawler. Previous games of the genre, such as Wizardry and Ultima, focused on long turn-based battles and thus were a little too ponderous for many. Dungeon Master's many boons to accessibility made it a huge hit.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The quest begins in the Hall of Champions. Portraits of fallen warriors line the hallways and as the player views these they are able to resurrect them to join the party. Champions must be selected carefully to complement each other as each have different skills and equipment that will be needed on the journey.The game featured a sophisticated experience system for the time in which it was made. Each character is able to progress in four classes: Fighter, Ninja, Priest and Wizard. Advancement in each is dependent on using the skills relevant to the profession. For example, a character put at the front of the party that attacks enemies with melee weapons will advance in the fighter class. Ninja classes are raised by throwing items, Priest classes are raised by creating potions through magic and Wizard classes are raised by casting offensive spells. At any point the player can simply choose to spam an activity over and over to raise their levels, as with each level raised in any class came additional health, mana and other stats. This helped mitigate the game's occasional difficulty spikes, such as the tough worm monsters on the fourth floor.As well as the experience system Dungeon Master gave each character a number of additional attributes that needed to be carefully managed throughout the quest. Characters would need food, drink and rest. Food can be occasionally found after defeating monsters, water supplies can be replenished in the occasional fountain and it is important to remember that sleeping wherever enemies were close is always a mistake.The magic system in Dungeon Master includes various recipes for spells and potions, which requires casting the correct magical runes in order. If combined correctly a spell would result. If not, nothing would occur, but the player would still lose mana from the attempt. Basic spells are provided via scrolls but many are left to the player's experimentation, with knowledge of what each individual rune symbolizes as clues.[CR]</plot>

The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.[CR]After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.[CR]The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.[CR]The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</plot>

				<plot>Dragon Wars takes place in the magical land of Dilmun, an island of salvation perverted into a world of horror by Namtar (as you might expect - the bad guy).[CR]The player starts with a party of four in the city of Purgatory, equipped with nothing more than.. well - nothing. Worst of all your magic users won't help you out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). [CR]Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based.[CR]Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill system, auto-mapping and many places to actually use all these abilities.[CR]Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical.</plot>

Progress is made in a fashion similar to that used in Epyx 'games' series, with alternating joystick movements. To help out, you carry a backpack which you may stock with assorted items. Since there is a weight limit, you must choose which items you most likely will need for a given trail. For example, an exceptionally long trail may require camping gear and some additional food, where as a short trail will allow for some more luxuries such as extra rope.</plot>

				<plot>Full Metal Planete is a tie-in of a board game of the same name. Up to four players land on a planet with their motherships, trying to gather as much ore as possible within 24 game rounds.This almost sounds like a happy, idyllic round of pick-the-flowers, if it weren't for the truckload of tanks and destroyers that each players happens to have in the cargo area of his mothership. So the players usually spend an equal amount of time picking up ore and bashing their contenders' heads in. The computer game is an accurate conversion of the board game; virtually every feature is present. Strategy is needed to succeed in the game. The only semi-random thing are the tides (high tide, low tide, and something in-between) which can strand boats and engulf tanks, but even they can be partially predicted.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gauntlet is a classic "dungeon crawling" game developed by Atari Games (which later became Tengen). Up to four players can take control of four different characters and fight their way through a dungeon of bad guys and loot treasure. Gauntlet was the first arcade cabinet to feature four player cooperative gameplay and it caused a sensation in the Arcade when it was released in 1985.[CR][B]Classes:[/B][CR]The character classes in Gauntlet are the: Thor the Warrior, Merlin the Wizard, Thyra the Valkyrie, or Questor the Elf whose colors are red, yellow, blue and green, respectively.Each character has its own abilities. Thor the Warrior, the slowest character, deals the most damage and is also the most effective character at close range. Merlin the Wizard is a fast character who is not good at close combat but has the most powerful magic, which is activated by using a potion found in the dungeon. Questor the Elf is the fastest character but is weak at close range. His long range shots make him a good scout (the Elf player often irritates other players since his extra speed allows him to steal all the treasure before anyone else can get a look-in!). Finally, Thyra the Valkyrie is the all-rounder who neither excels nor fails in any given department.[CR]Objectives and Gameplay[CR]The objective of Gauntlet is to progress through a massive dungeon with hundreds of levels. On each level the player(s) must reach the exit in order to advance to the next level. However the dungeon's denizens are there to make reaching that exit a tough task. Dungeons are populated by all manner of nasties including: Ghosts, Grunts, Demons, Lobbers and, of course, Death himself! Enemies in Gauntlet commonly spawn from generators and will do so inexorably until the generators are destroyed. Other features of the dungeon include locked doors, secret rooms, and teleporters.Each hero has a numerical value representing their health on the the screen. This number steadily ticks down to zero even when the hero is not taking any damage. Since vast hordes of enemies are all competing for a chunk of the heroes health, it is not an easy task to survive in Gauntlet. One remedy for this rapidly diminishing health for the arcade version is to drop more coins into the slot to buy more health points. Food pick-ups are also scattered around the dungeon which boost the health of whoever collects them. Unfortunately, food only gives the hero another 100 points of health, which doesn't last long.To make life a little easier for the heroes there are power-ups which can be collected; these include temporary invisibility, an armor boost, and extra shot speed or power. Since all characters occupy the same game screen, a good deal of cooperation is required in order for a group of players to successfully navigate the levels. A good team will fairly distribute the bonuses to the most suitable hero, i.e. "let the Wizard have the potions". A bad Elf player can spoil the groups chances by snatching everything!One of the most memorable features of Gauntlet is the audio. The game has an announcer who, in all his 8-bit glory, declaims important messages such as "Wizard shot the food!" or "Warrior needs food badly!" At the time, it was impressive that a game had audible speech in 1985, which was novel.[CR]Gauntlet's Origins[CR]Gauntlet was originally a copy, with some upgrades, of a game by John Palevich, who contributed his dungeon crawler to Atari through the Atari Program eXchange. Palevich later sued for compensation, or at least name recognition in the credits of the Gauntlet arcade games. Atari was said to have recognized Palevich's role in the creation of Gauntlet, but as the arcade machines were already made, they maintained that adding Palevich's name would have been prohibitively expensive. Palevich was later given token compensation from Atari in recognition of his unwitting role in the creation of this game.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Geographic Jigsaw USA is an educational game that consists of four activities, including two games: Jigsaw and Map Quiz. In addition to these there is Map Facts which is an interactive map of the USA where the user can click on any of the states and get various data (capital, area, population etc.) and Stat Maps which consists of a number of non-interactive statistical maps showing for example population density or energy usage.Jigsaw works like other jigsaw puzzle games but here the pieces are the states of the USA. The player's task is simply to click on a state and drag it to the right place on the map. There are three difficulty levels that alter the gameplay. On the easy and medium levels the states' outlines are shown on the map which they are not on the hard one. Medium and hard difficulties also have some states that needs to be rotated to fit. When a state has successfully been put in place, its name and capital will be displayed on the easy level while on the medium level the names has to be entered by the player and on the hard level both has to be entered.Map Quiz asks questions to the player and the player has to click on the correct state on the map. Different categories can be chosen depending on difficulty levels, including capitals, cities, landmarks, features and history. </plot>

				<plot>Gnarly Golf is a mini golf game that consists of eighteen holes, none of which looks or behaves much like real life mini golf. Each hole is a single screen in size and is viewed from a top down perspective. Locations include a pool hall, a prison and the roof of a skyscraper and often involve a puzzle element where the player has to figure out how to reach the hole.The game is entirely played with the mouse and uses a three click process to launch a shot. The first click is for choosing the direction to aim in and a circular swing meter will then appear. An indicator on the meter shows the direction and a second indicator will start moving backwards. The second click decides the power of the swing with maximum force being applied when the indicator goes all the way back. The third click sets the spin of the ball which then will be released.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gold Rush! is a 1988 educational adventure game created by brothers Ken and Doug MacNeill. The game uses Sierra's AGI game engine, combining a graphical presentation with a text parser interface.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Players control Jerrod Wilson, a newspaper worker in Brooklyn Heights in 1848. As news of the discovery of gold in California spreads, Jerrod decides to risk it all and undertake the perilous journey west in search of fortune.Preparing for the journey.After selling his house and securing supplies in New York, the player chooses one of three paths through the game: traveling overland, crossing the Isthmus of Panama, or sailing around Cape Horn. The journey is reminiscent of The Oregon Trail, as the player must avoid death from horrible diseases, starvation, and/or killer ants.Upon arriving in California, you can wander the wilderness around Sacramento, panning for gold in streams. Eventually, you will find notes left by your brother, leading you to a perilous cave. The final challenge is to venture inside, where -- if you survive -- you may find the mother lode and be rewarded with more gold than you dreamed possible.[CR]Availability[CR]Gold Rush is apparently still available for purchase directly from the MacNeill brothers' company The Software Farm. According to the company's website, customers can purchase the game in a collector's edition that includes a poster-sized map and comes in a handmade wooden box. The website depicts the game being offered on 3.5 inch floppy discs; it is unknown whether other physical media formats are currently available.The game was also released on Steam in 2014.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Formula One racing is recreated in detail in this simulation. You can drive a McLaren, Ferrari or Williams car, each with different qualities, around the real-life Formula One circuits including Monaco, Suzuka and the original Hockenheim circuit characterized by long straights. Rival drivers also have their own styles and strengths, and to win the World Championship you will have to master these. Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s F1. Graphics are sprite-based.</plot>

				<plot>Talking Cloze Technique: Greek Mythology is an educational game that teaches reading in context. It contains eight stories adapted from various Greek myths. Each story consists of multiple pages of text which are accompanied with pictures that can be clicked on to start a brief animation. On each page there are two omitted words that the student should fill in. Clicking on the blanks will lead to an animated owl called Mo Mentum appearing who will offer a choice of three words. Clicking on the right one will allow the student to continue with the story. After filling in all the words a score will be given and if more than 75% of the answers were correct the student will be awarded with a golden key. The myths included are:	Daedalus and Icarus	Jason and Medea	Odysseus	Heracles	Perseus and Medusa	Theseus and the Minotaur	Persephone and Pluto	Pandora</plot>

				<plot>In Great Western Shootout the player takes the role of the Lone Lawman who is on a mission to clean up his town from criminals. It's a shooting gallery game played from a first person perspective without movement. The player moves a crosshair with the mouse and has to shoot the villains as they peek out from behind cover. If he takes too long the enemies will instead shoot him, leading to a loss of health. At the same time the player has to watch out for civilians. If these are shot, some health will be lost, too. To regain health the player has to shoot the medicine bags that appear on the screen for brief moments. Keeping track of ammo is also important as once it's been used it takes some time to reload.For each outlaw killed the player earns 15 gold and at the end of the game the player might reach a high score. The game can be played by one or two players. In two player mode players take turns playing each level.</plot>

				<plot>Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers is a real-time strategy game.It is the sequel to Hacker.Once again you hack into a computer system, just to end up saving the world. Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the "Actisource" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again,  involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden.In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras. Whew, sounds like a lot of work? It is.</plot>

				<plot>Hover Blade is an action game that uses a chase view similar to Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom and Space Harrier. The game involves steering a hovercraft with the mouse as it automatically moves forward and the objective is to reach the end without crashing. The path ahead is full of various obstacles such as trees, bushes and structures which has to be avoided since collisions leads to a loss of power. When all out of power the craft will be destroyed. The craft also has a limited amount of fuel and it's necessary to collect fuel canisters to refill. Missiles can be used to destroy obstacles but come in limited supply. To recharge the missiles the craft has to fly through a black sphere. The player will also come across gates that when flown through gives bonus points once a level has been completed. </plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Inventory Screen (Amiga)The game follows an apprentice who discovers a message in a puff of smoke from an enchanted candle from the Wizard Mordamir who is trapped in the dungeon far below and counting on Dunric to save him. Continuing further in the dungeon, the apprentice encounters goblins, trolls, and all manner of traps and monsters. While sleeping on straw, he dreams of an ancient city a thousand years old with water and young people everywhere. On his way through the dungeon he frees Ana, Dunric's daughter. Then the apprentice learns that the ancient city was a place where waters from the Fountain of Youth would flow from goblins who ask for his help in distracting The Norlac, a sort of water monster, in the canals below. Through another dream, he learns of an ancient peaceful civilization of dragons guarding the Fountain of Youth. Using his wits, the apprentice tricks the monster into falling into a whirlpool, but then he also is sucked in. Barely surviving the event, the wizard presses forth and has another dream. This time it's about the ancient city's council members and wizards gathering together and planning a siege, and then flashes of battles between wizards and dragons. By now he is nearing the bottom of the dungeon, and at the bottom he discovers one dragon survived the war.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Magic Carpet ride (DOS)The Immortal has a lot of item-based puzzle solving, lots of deadly enemy encounters, tons of traps, and requires patience to survive. At times the game is unforgiving, wherein if you use items before they're required or in the wrong place the game will make it impossible to proceed. Sometimes the traps will be inanely difficult to proceed through, such as the infamous "Worm Room". Thankfully each level is short, so if you survive through it all you can record the "certificate" (what The Immortal calls its passwords) and continue playing another time. Combat in this game is either about entirely avoiding enemies, or going to a combat screen where the idea is to dodge until you build up your stamina and then start slashing the enemies to bits with your sword. There are several spell scrolls to pick up, and at one point even a magic spellbook that allows you to cast a minor fireball spell infinitely. The game also has certain points where you can float around to avoid the giant worms and tiny spiders such as the magic carpet and the levitation spell. This mechanic feels the same each time, as it's almost like controlling a car that can constantly accelerate, but the controls are quite horrendous and it's hard to survive these segments, as well as the one later in the game with the creature in the water canals while riding a barrel.The game has a few alternate endings with minor detail differences, based upon actions earlier in the game.DeathDueling the giant Spider Queen (DOS)In "The Immortal", there are so many ways to die, and many ways to kill. When fighting goblins and trolls, the apprentice can decapitate them, slice them in half at the waist, and from the head to the groin, make their heads explode, cause them to turn to ashes, and skin them alive. The apprentice himself can be consumed by slimes, body slammed and eaten by giant worms that burst through the ground, fall through trap doors, get stepped on during a shrink spell, use an amulet that causes him to die instantly, fed upon by a giant Queen Spider, and can be eaten alive by hundreds of tiny spiders.[CR]Alternate Versions[CR]Level 6The sixth level of the game only appears in certain versions of the title. It features the giant spider Queen and the tiny spider sacks that when touched will overwhelm the apprentice with dozens of spiders that eat him alive. The level also features a brief portion where the wizard can acquire some alcohol, and either drink it or use it to solve a puzzle. Drinking the alcohol would actually intoxicate the player, and make every direction the apprentice would walk in completely random.Amount of GoreThe PC and Genesis/Mega Drive versions of this game had a markedly different level of gore during finishing moves in battle. Most of the gory deaths were absent from the PC version, while the Genesis/Mega Drive version had bloody eviscerations which were all kinds of awesome.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>KaleidoKubes is a puzzle game where players places cubes on a board. The game is meant for two players, either against a human or against the computer, but there is also a practice mode for one player. Each cube is split into four triangles of different colours (blue, green, red, yellow) and to place one on the board the colour of each side has to match the colours of adjacent cubes. Each cube has to connect to at least one other cube. The players earn points for each cube that is placed on the board and the more sides that are connected the more points will be earned. The game is turn based and each player has a limited time (30 or 60 seconds depending on settings) and when it's out the player gets a point penalty and the opponent takes over. For each turn the player has just one cube which can be rotated and if he can't find a solution it's possible to pass. The winner is the player with the highest score when the board is filled or when two consecutive combinations of time running out or passes have been made.</plot>

				<plot>Katie's Farm is a sequel to McGee. Like that game it is an educational game for young children that is entirely wordless so that it can be played independently without assistance from an adult. The gameplay is identical to the first game but this time it takes place at a farm and McGee is joined by a second character, his cousin Katie. The farm consists of a few different locations (barn, paddock, hen house etc.) and for each there are four icons to click on which cause the two characters to interact with the environment in different ways. This include meeting different animals (cows, horses, chickens etc.), playing with a scarecrow and jumping in a haystack. There's no end to the game so the player can explore the farm freely.</plot>

				<title_clean>Keef the Thief</title_clean>
				<plot>Play Keef the Thief, a promising young thief who finds himself on the outskirts of the Mercon the Merchant City. Considering the penalty of thievery is the removal of certain body parts, our young hero must be careful in his profession and ultimately (among others) train himself to access and steal from the city treasury.Keef the Thief: A Boy and His Lockpick is a first-person perspective role-playing game. It has elements of parody, clearly identifiable from various descriptions in the game and enemy names during combat. One of the goals in the game is to steal everything in sight - at least in the city. The game map itself includes, beside the city, various dungeons, jungles, and an arena, among others.The game introduces four vital elements of game play: Thievery, Adventuring, Combat, and Alchemy:ThieveryThe thievery element is based on the ability to disarm traps before the player can loot treasure. There are many houses or other places where the player can steal valuable objects (at least within the city walls). The higher the skills, the more options the player has to rightly pick which course the player wants to choose to disarm a trap.AdventuringWhen the player has stolen everything valuable from underwear to gold crowns from the city, eventually the player will have to venture outside the city into the unknown depths of the surrounding jungle. There are a lot of places that has yet to be discovered in the game. Just be sure to be well equipped with armor and weapons. Monsters have a bad habit of popping up, almost always!CombatThe first-person real-time combat setting comes complete with a top-down radar indicating the player's positioning and the enemies. In the combat screen the player can melee to victory or just shoot them from a distance. That is if the player has the appropriate weapons available.AlchemyFor the most part it's alchemy, though magic spells are also created through this process. Collecting ingredients is one thing, experimenting on what works is another. Sometimes the player may get lucky and find a recipe. Sometimes.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]King's Quest is an early PC Adventure game. The player navigates Sir Graham through dozens of brightly colored two-dimensional game screens, collecting items and interacting with strange characters.

				<plot>After having recovered the three treasures, King Graham has been crowned king. Now having needing a queen for companionship, Graham searches the land for a maiden, but to no avail, so he turns to the magic mirror for help. The mirror shows him a beautiful girl locked away in a quartz tower in a faraway land of Kolyma, and must find three keys that are used to unlock the door that will lead to her. [CR]King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne is a graphic adventure game. As is typical for Sierra's AGI games, players move Graham around with arrow keys and perform actions by typing commands in the interface, which are usually a verb/noun sequence. Like the first game, a good knowledge of fairy tales is required to solve some puzzles.</plot>

				<plot>Life &amp; Death is a game which casts you as a doctor in a hospital. Your job is to diagnose patients and administer appropriate therapies, or even perform surgery when necessary. To diagnose a patient, you have to press on his or her abdomen, to see which portions of the stomach cause pain. Basing on this knowledge, you can choose a therapy for him (observation, medication or referring to another specialist) or administer a X-Ray or ultrasound scan to get more information about his illness. In some cases, surgery will be necessary. You're the surgeon and you have to perform the operation very carefully, adhering strictly to the procedures, preserving hygiene, and maintaining care when cutting up the patient. Should you mistakenly administer the wrong therapy, or kill your patient at the operating table, you're kicked into the medical school, where you're given hints as to what you've done wrong. </plot>

				<plot>Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure.[CR]Larry, the game's protagonist, is a short, tacky, balding, leisure suit-wearing kinda guy who's constantly searching for his next score. His combination of stupidity and brashness gets Larry into trouble. The object is to get him out of trouble in traditional adventure fashion, finding and manipulating objects as you thread your way through the story line. The content is comedic and adult-oriented. A graphical interface is used with a text parser to input commands. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions.</plot>

There are different question formats: multiple choice or fill-in the blanks for reading questions and fill-in, synonyms or antonyms for vocabulary questions.The program comes with an editor called myth maker that allows the user to create new stories as well as accompanying questions with answers. There is also a mythical match game which is a concentration game where the players have to flip cards to reveal pictures with the aim of uncovering all the images. </plot>

				<plot>Mancala is a family of boards games where the aim is to capture seeds that are placed in a number of bowls. This particular game is based on Oware (or Wari as it is called in the manual) a variant that originates from western Africa. The game can be played by one player against an AI or against another human player. Both players have six bowls and when starting out there are four seeds in each bowl. The two players then has to sow their seeds and they take turns doing so. Sowing means that the player takes all the seeds from one bowl and places them in each bowl counter-clockwise from the bowl that is being emptied. The aim of the game is to capture seeds and this happens automatically when the last placed seed in a turn leads to a bowl on the opponent's side of the board having two or three seeds. The player making the move will then capture all seeds in that bowl. If the previous bowl also has two or three seeds these too are captured until a bowl that doesn't contain two or three seeds is reached. The winner of the game is the player that captures the most seeds. Since there are 48 seeds in total capturing 25 seeds is enough to win.</plot>

				<plot>The Earth has been invaded by the Orb Alliance, and a tightly restricted regime instituted for the humans that remain. Brown monk robes are the only garments allowed, speaking is a capital offense, and every human has been implanted with a tracking chip recording their every move. To track down criminals, the Orbs enlist "Manhunters" - humans given access to advanced technology and selected to be a combination of police officers and bounty hunters. The player controls one such Manhunter as he unravels a conspiracy inside the decaying heart of the New York ruins, and a mysterious serial killer on the loose.Each chapter begins with the Orbs assigning the player's nameless Manhunter with a crime (such as murder) or target to investigate. The player gains leads through the use of the "MAD" computer, which displays the logs of all civilian movement in an area in an overhead map view.  By starting with the victim and following the people who encountered him that day, the player can then go to a first-person investigation view at various New York landmarks to find clues to the suspect's identity.  At the end of the day, the player must report the correct name of their suspect to the Orbs.Manhunter uses a modified version of Sierra's AGI interpreter, with a rudimentary point-and-click interface used to locate and uncover clues at the investigation sites. At various times throughout the investigation, the player will also have to directly control the Manhunter in arcade-style challenges, like dodging gang attacks or throwing knives between a bar patron's fingers. </plot>

				<title_clean>Marble Madness</title_clean>
				<plot>A port of the arcade game. The idea is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</plot>

				<plot>An updated version of the older Math Blaster! educational game.  Unlike the previous version, this one's not in BASIC!A new GUI greets users, called the "Davidson Student Desktop Interface"- this allows people to switch from one portion of the game to the next  without all that nasty _typing_.The math is broken down into five subjects- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and fractions/decimals/percents.  The game itself is broken into 5 activities-Countdown- a flash-card style "game" with no scoring or timing.  A problem, with answer, is shown on screen- upon command, the same problem appears sans answer, and must be answered correctly.Ignition- problems appear, and upon a correct answer, motivational messages and animations pop up.  The player has two chances to answer correctly, and receives a scoreboard at the end showing number of problems, number solved, etc.  (This scoreboard appears in the next two listed activities.)Lift-off- problems appear, with answer, but missing an internal component (like 2 * _ = 12).  Three chances per problem are given to answer correctly.  Once again, there are encouraging messages and animations- and a certificate of achievement may be printed out.Orbit- three problems appear on-screen with portions of each in boxes; these boxes may contain errors and need to be changed by the player.  Each correct answer earns a star, and the player can attempt to answer twice.  This one also can print a certificate of achievement.Blasternaut- the action-oriented math activity- you control a Blasternaut that must get into a rocket aimed at the correct answer to a shown problem.  Bonus points are awarded if you can rescue floating Blasternauts- apparently slamming into them with the nosecone of a huge rocket constitutes help.The math problems contained within aren't randomly generated, but are pre-written lessons (which are handily printed in the instruction manuals.)  Math Blaster Plus! can be used to create new lessons, can be used in a classroom setting to track individual students' performance, and can print stored lessons as paper-based quizzes/tests for more traditional (and more boring) use.</plot>

				<title_clean>McGee At The Fun Fair</title_clean>
				<plot>McGee at the Fun Fair is the third game in the McGee series. Like the previous two games it is an educational game for young children that is entirely wordless so that it can be played by the child alone without any help from a parent. The gameplay is identical to the previous games but this time McGee has travelled to a fun fair and along with him comes a friend called Tony. The fair consists of a few different locations and for each there are four icons to click on that cause the two characters to interact with the environment in different ways. This includes watching the various entertainers (a clown, a juggler and a one man band for instance), having fun on the playground and eating ice cream. The game does not have an end sequence so the player can explore the locations freely for any length of time.</plot>

				<plot>McGee is an educational game for young children (ages 2 to 6). The game is entirely wordless and tells its story through graphics and sound making it possible for the child to play the game without help from an adult. The idea is that the child in this way should become familiar and confident with the computer and grow a sense of discovery. In the game the player takes control of a child protagonist called McGee and gets to explore his home. The house consists of a couple of rooms and in each room there are a few objects that can be interacted with. All interaction is done by clicking on the four different icons that appear in each room. When doing so a short animation will start and McGee will do something, for example play with a ball, take a bath or hide under the carpet. There is no specific objective to the game and the player can move around freely between the rooms and interact with things over and over again.</plot>

				<plot>Pebbele Beach and St. Andrews are two of the courses on offer in this golf simulation, released in the early years of 16-bit technology. The three-click control system was used, whereby the first click starts the swing, the second sets the power, and the third sets draw or fade.[CR]Beginner and Expert difficulty options are given - the latter mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click even more crucial. You can also choose between regular and professional tees - in the latter option the distance on the holes is longer, and the computer doesn't choose the best club automatically. Because long drives aren't a crucial aspect of many of the holes, the Begginer/Expert setting is a bigger factor on your likely scoring. A uniquie feature for the day was the course designer, which was quite versatile with practice.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Name your character wellNeuromancer is an adventure game somewhat based on the rough, dilapidated world behind William Gibson's Neuromancer. Contained within the game's narrative are several quotes directly from Gibson's book.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]You may have to sell organs to pay your debtsThe game uses the walking exploration of adventure games of the time, combined with text entry for interaction. You initially navigate through screens representing the city sprawl of Chiba, earning money to buy upgraded software and items.The story is not initially evident, but is instead discovered over time as you explore the online communities and gain ever deeper access to connected systems. [CR]Cyberspace[CR]The game features cyberspace in its second half, where a player can sail in a virtual world. Data is the only real thing of worth in a world where everything is mass produced. You Hack through computer systems from data node to data node, trying to secure this valuable data,. In cyberspace the player navigates a 2D plane, and when entering data nodes can attempt to break through an AI defender's shields to crack open security access. This is abstracted through a series of attacks and counterattacks that are displayed in real-time. The real-time element does require some reaction time, but the events pause when in menus.An important aspect of AI battles is analysis of the target AI. You will often find a weakness in the entity's mental makeup which will allow you to employ things like philosophy or sophistry to disable it. If you're successful, you gain access. If you fail, you flatline, winding up in a body bank where you're revived, sans cash.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Omega is a new direction in game design. The plot is innocent enough: futuristic tanks battling. There is a twist, however: the tanks are controlled by computers. It's your job, as the player, not to control the tanks in real time, but to learn a programming language designed for the game to build an artificial intelligence that will allow the tank to survive. Omega includes a massive manual that needs to be read before tackling the game.</plot>

				<plot>[CR]The Game[CR]Paperboy ArcadePaperboy was released to arcades in 1984 by Atari Games. It featured a custom bicycle handle controller that the player would use to accelerate, brake, and turn the titular Paperboy's bicycle on screen. A button would cause him to throw his paper to the left, to either deliver the paper perfectly in a mailbox or doorstep, or for more destructive purposes.There are three different courses on which you can deliver papers: Easy Street, Middle Road, and Hard Way. You score points for each paper successfully delivered to a subscriber, but also for breaking the windows or other household features of non-subscribers. Each run through the course would be a single day, with an entire game consisting of delivering Monday through Sunday. At the end of each day any subscribers that had a paper successfully delivered would give a bonus. Any subscribers missed on that day would unsubscribe for the following day. If you delivered perfectly to each house you would receive double points for each subscriber, and, unless at the max, get a formerly lost subscriber back.Each day would get progressively harder, with even Easy Street being quite challenging by Thursday or Friday. The difficulty was ramped up by adding more obstacles, making the doorsteps and mailboxes harder to get at, and increasing the speed of cross traffic on the one intersection. Each run through a particular day is the same, however, so eventually the player can memorize the various patterns.At the end of the street is the "Training Course", which is an obstacle course with targets, jumps, and static obstacles suitable for running up more points. At then end, a grandstand is filled with your cheering fans.EnemiesDanger LurksStatic obstacles, such as low brick walls, mailboxes, bushes, garbage cans, push-mowers, fences, and the houses themselves cause you to immediately fall off your bicycle, losing a life. The player is forced to be moving forward at all times, and can only turn so quickly left or right, so it is easy to get in situations where the player just cannot move to the side quickly enough to avoid them.Mobile obstacles, such as dogs, cars, drunks, men fighting, uni-cyclists, skeletons, RC cars, those evil, evil skateboarding kids, and more are a constant threat, popping up without much warning, crashing into you or forcing you into something else.IncarnationsThere have been many console and handheld versions of Paperboy, from the Commodore 64 and TRS-80 all the way to Xbox Live Arcade.StrategyAmazing Paperboy Delivers!If you're playing to complete a full week, focus on not dying at all until at least Thursday. Get as many points as you can to build up extra lives. Don't be afraid to ride on the lawns, although if you run over any of the flowers of your subscribers, they will promptly unsubscribe.A good technique for crossing the busy intersection on Easy Street is to go forward, pause for the car rushing by, then go forward quickly.The individual days don't vary, so memorization of enemy locations is key. It gets tricky, because you're on the same course and can find yourself on Monday avoiding an enemy that doesn't show up until Friday or forgetting to avoid something on Wednesday because you thought they weren't until later in the week. Memorization and twitch reflexes are the name of the game.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Pick 'n Pile</title_clean>
				<plot>Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.[CR]In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</plot>

				<plot>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</plot>

				<plot>Take on the life of a buccaneer in the golden age of Caribbean Piracy! This game lets you choose from 6 different "ages" (for example, "The Silver Empire" from 1560-1600, "War For Profit" from 1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were represented. The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of "evil Spaniards" holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc.  The game is educational, as you will learn about piracy through the thoroughly researched manual. You'll smell the sea salt as you participate in wild sword fights, desperate sea battles, and daring attacks by land.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In QIX, the objective is to fence in a large majority of the play field and defeat the QIX. Players must close in the large enemy, the QIX, in a closed space without it touching the player or the lines drawn by the player. Every time the player creates a closed space, they are awarded points and the space becomes solid so the QIX can no longer pass through it. Other enemies besides the QIX exist in the form of Sparx. The Sparx moves on the lines that the player draws and can defeat the player in the same way as the QIX.QIX was originally released in arcades in 1981 but Taito ported the game to a large variety of consoles such as the Atari 5200, Atari 400/800, Apple II, Commodore 64, DOS, Amiga (with new graphics), Apple IIGS, NES, and Atari Lynx. Nintendo also developed a Game Boy version that featured Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach.[CR]</plot>

You start out as a lowly peasant with only a few gold coins in your pocket and a bad attitude to defend yourself. By stumbling around the countryside and fighting hordes of creatures, you gain wealth, experience, and title.[CR]Questron II spans two continents, Landor and the Realm of Sorcerers. Additionally, there are the requisite tombs, castles, and dungeons. In the first Questron, your goal was to defeat the evil Wizard Mantor. Now, in Questron II, the good Wizard Mesron has sent you back in time before the Book of Magic was created. Your goal is to defeat the six Mad Sorcerers before they can create the book.</plot>

				<plot>Reach for the Stars is a "spaceploitation" game. The player has the opportunity to name his civilization and those of his (up to three) AI opponents before he begins his attempt at galactic domination. The 2D galaxy map is marked only by planets and their names in few different colors. Also, there is no diplomacy and no player control over tactical combat.What remains is a hard-core game of grand strategic and economic production. The player must tweak his planets, build ships, research new tech levels, and deploy fleets. All of the underlying dynamics can be altered and customized by the player.</plot>

				<plot>Revolution '76 is a political, economic and military simulation of the struggle for independence of the American colonies.The game begins in 1775 with the convocation of the Second Continental Congress. Each turn represents a year during which the player sets policies (e.g. the attitude towards loyalists), assigns leaders to administrative positions (historical figures, each with their own set of characteristics), recruits military support and manpower (for the continental army, state militia and privateers on the sea), negotiates alliances with European states, regulates the economy (inflation) and raises taxes (even the slave issue is taken into consideration). The player's government eventually formally declares independence from Britain, leading to civil war, forcing the player to defend the confederated rebelling colonies. The battles are resolved automatically, based on army strength &amp; quality, the presence of a general, morale and supply level. The final outcome may range from a successful defense of a fledgling independence, through a partial autonomy, to an unconditional surrender.</plot>

				<plot>In the 1940s, the Nazis built a base on the moon and plan to use a mysterious substance called Lunarium to reduce people's intelligence. However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.[CR]The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]   Roadwar 2000 is a  post-apocalyptic tactical game set in what is left of the United States and whose gameplay is primarily based on vehicular combat. The player is in charge of a group of individuals armed with various vehicles and must manage their resources and dictate their actions in a bid to survive and discover the cure to a terrible plague sweeping the nation.  After successfully building and maintaining a strong force, the player may eventually be approached by what is left of the US Government to find six scientists that may hold the final pieces of the cure needed to stop the bio-engineered plague still infecting the nation.  [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]   On March 29, 1999, the first cases of an extremely virulent plague are reported in Washington DC. According a journal chronicling the plague, the virus is extremely debilitating with death as the end result. On May 7th, it has spread across the nation. But the cause has been discovered: a bacterium that has three different growth stages. The first stage is a pupal stage, much like a caterpillar. The second stage does damage to the neurological system of the human body. The third stage, which occurs two months later, results in death.  By May 27th, it is discovered that the plague had been spread by fanaticists using fake passports and was an intentional attack on the United States.  On June 8th, one of the fanatics has been captured and is willing to talk. Scientists working for their sect had developed the genetically engineered bacteria, injected one hundred volunteers, and then sent them into the United States. Nearly 82% of the country has already been infected. But the most revealing piece of information was that the sect had also developed a cure. Of course, the fanatic wasn't willing to share any other information concerning it.  By June 13th, the country has begun to descend into anarchy. Most of the leadership including the President and Congress are laid up in hospitals if they are still alive. Meanwhile, the task force assigned to find a cure feverishly attempt to continue their work.  On July 7th, one of the Secretaries of the United States calls the bunker warning them that things are slipping from their control faster than expected. The scientists claim that they are close to a breakthrough.  The scientific team are given vitamin pellets to supplement their own food supplies on July 8th as the Secretary tells them of the plans to relocate them to secure locations.     The bombs fell on July 20th hitting strategic cities. With most of the United States' defenses already damaged by the crippling plague, there was nothing to stop them. But not all of the weapons had gone off, leaving certain cities with an unexploded nuclear device sitting at their heart. People flee the irradiated zones. Those strong enough to enforce their own rule take control of certain areas within these devastated ruins.   Many of the gangs secure their power through the use of politicians that they find to work for them, doctors that can heal the sick (if not cure the plague), and a drill officer that can train their men.  On August 2nd, the invaders arrive by landing on the coasts or by moving through Mexico. Inoculated against the plague, they make progress. With most of the nation's infrastructure shattered, little word makes it back to the main bunker where the research continues, although word reaches them from one of the eight scientists sent out that a breakthrough is very close.  On August 21st, it is discovered that the radiation from the bombs has mutated the bacterium, causing intense rage and uncontrolled violence within the infected now dubbed the "mutants". With its mutation, the serum used by the invaders to protect themselves fails and their own ranks are infected by this new strain. A new vaccine is available, but the cure requires the price of having to heal everyone in a group at once or risk reinfection, further depleting the scarce resources.  By October 6th, travel has become all but impossible. By November 20th, supplies begin to dwindle at the main bunker. A plan is initiated to find help by picking one of the gang leaders to aid them in bringing the scientists back.  By December 25th, the journal's author writes his final entry. Now only the player can save what is left of the United States in a bid for survival. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   On starting the game, the player is randomly placed in one of the cities left somewhat intact within the United States. Most of the game places the player in the management role of their gang; allocating resources, managing their manpower, and gathering recruits to build up their cause. The game is turn based with each representing one hour.  Experience improves the effectiveness of your gang members, although there are no levels. Combat can also expand the number of vehicles that the player can have at their disposal. Cities can be looted once their defenders have been defeated and supplies are almost always in demand, especially fuel.   The game is viewed from a top-down perspective allowing the player to view such things as roads, obstacles, and potential destinations (such as cities) and natural landmarks such as lakes, rivers, and mountains. Most of the controls are handled via hotkey commands and movement is also keyboard controlled. The game also uses a series of random encounters.  Many large cities are held by powerful gangs with their own small armies and many of these must be taken by the player in order to initiate the main quest in the game: recovering the scientists that have the cure to the disease.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>A mouse-driven shoot-em-up which was only ever released for the Apple IIgs. The player controls a red helicopter which must defend an escaping convoy of ships at the bottom of the screen. This convoy is under constant attack from incoming gunboats, torpedoes, and the like.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists primarily of destroying incoming hazards by shooting them down; a limited number of immolation charges are also available, which set the player's helicopter on fire for a short period of time, which causes it to destroy anything it touches. The game ends when either all the player's ships or helicopters are destroyed.</plot>

				<plot>Shanghai is a tile-based game based on the ancient Chinese game of Mah-Jong - this was the first of many computer versions.[CR]The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.[CR]This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on, as well as featuring 5 preset challenges, some of which have time limits of 5 or 10 minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</plot>

				<plot>The story contains some differences between the home computer versions and the later Sega CD version, making many consider the Sega CD game a sequel rather than a re-release, though the gameplay and many boss encounters are largely the same.In the home computer versions the primary antagonist is the named terrorist Xacalite, who has hijacked one Earth's finest battlecruisers, the Gloire, armed with planet buster weapons, and who over the course of the game actually blows up Earth.The Sega CD version instead tells the story of the first encounter with an unknown alien species, which upon meeting humans decide to attack (and, like in the PC version, end up destroying) Earth. The Sega CD's version of the story is also the premise for  the later games in the series, such as Silpheed: The Lost Planet for PS2 and Silpheed: Alternative AM for Android. The name of the player's ship is also different between the computer and console versions - it's name SA-08 Silpheed in the home computer version, and SA-77 Silpheed on the Sega CD.On the technical side, both the home computer and console versions of the game were very advanced for their time - the home computer version was an early showcase for real time polygonal graphics, as well as the Roland MT-32 sound card. The game and it's music on a tape were often bundled with the sound card.The Sega CD version does things slightly differently - the player's ship and the smaller enemies encountered in the game are still polygonal, but the detailed set-piece backgrounds are pre-rendered FMV, rendered in high resolutions, but low color and with a relatively low framerate in order for the console to be able to run it in full screen, the result is still a stunningly detailed, though stylized play field, where massive ships fight and blow up in the distance, and with a seamless transition between cutscenes and gameplay, with some relatively advanced camera movement that was unrivaled at the time of release, and for many years thereafter.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Sega CD version review scores of 9,7,7 and 7. Ed Semrad, who gave the highest score wrote, "...some of the most stunning visuals in a video game. The cinemas are unbelievable. The game itself is rather mundane. It is a simple shooter, that seems to lack real interaction with the amazing backgrounds. The fame play is solid, however, and there is absolutely no slowdown whatsoever. I only wish there could have been more interaction".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Silent Service is an NES game in which the player controls a submarine and patrols and engages in skirmishes with other submarines. Its is more like a submarine sim then a traditional arcade game.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Silent Service is set in the Pacific Ocean during World War Two. The player assumes control of a U.S. Submarine, the U.S.S. Raven, which is assigned missions to carry out. This side of the war is rarely told in games. There are two types of game modes to play; Convoy Actions and War Patrol. Convoy Actions are specific scenarios in which the player is given a specific objective to complete. In War Patrol mode players are given the ability to roam anywhere in the Pacific  for 30 days looking for Japanese ships to attack. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This game is basically a submarine simulation game. It uses realistic tactics such as the End Around, as well as having the ability to adjust visibility and dud torpedoes. The game also gives you control of the rudders, periscope, and ballast, as well as displaying the speed, depth, and heading of your sub. You are placed in the waters of Japan and you are required to ping ships with your sonar in order to detect enemies. This game has a relatively steep learning curve to it.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The ace janitor Roger Wilco thought he'd seen the last of Sludge Vohaul. However, like every evil scientist is supposed to, Vohaul returns with an even meaner scheme. This time he intends to infest the planet Xenon with thousands of genetically engineered door-to-door life insurance salesmen. The last thing he wants is Roger messing things up, and so the brave janitor is captured and brought to the planet Labion to spend the rest of his days working in Vohaul's mines. Fortunately, the shuttle that takes him to the mines crashes, and Roger is the only survivor. He will have to survive the dangers of the jungle planet Labion, and eventually stop Vohaul from executing his mad plan.Vohaul's Revenge is the sequel to The Sarien Encounter, and the second game in Sierra's humorous Space Quest series of adventure games. The player navigates Roger Wilco around with arrow keys, and interacts with the world by typing commands. Like in the previous game, there are many ways for the player character to die. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to avoiding the many traps and hazards Roger will meet on his way. Some actions must be performed quickly in order to prevent Roger from getting killed.</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Story  [CR]Space Quest 2 picks up after the adventures of         Space Quest 1. Having saved Xenon from the Sariens, Roger became a hero and received the coveted golden mop award. Now, after some time has passed, people have moved on and the once beloved hero has been forgotten. However, as a reward for his heroism, Roger was made the head janitor of the Orbital Station 4, made a little less sweet by the fact that he is the only member of the janitorial staff.    One day while doing his duties he is called to clean a newly arrived transport ship that someone vomited in. After stepping into the vehicle, our hero is abducted and whisked off to a strange        space station. Turns out Sludge Vohaul, the commander of the Sariens, is a little cheesed with Roger's past exploits and seeks revenge. So he sentences Roger to a lifetime of working in his Labion Labor Mines while Sludge plans on releasing his new plan for world domination against Xenon. The release of millions of door to door salesmen!      While our hero is being taken to his grim new fate, the transport he's on runs out of gas. Fortunately Roger lands on one of his captors, cushioning his fall. Roger is then forced to find his way off Labion and stop the nefarious Sludge from his evil plans. Roger faces many perils, overcomes death many times, and finally makes his way onto Sludge's space station. After some more perils and death defying, he manages to overcome Sludge and destroy the station.     Roger manages to escape the exploding station just in time in an       escape pod. Unfortunately, Roger picks one with limited fuel and finds himself soon adrift in space. With no other recourse, he puts himself into cryogenic hibernation hoping for a passing ship to find and rescue him.    [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]  [CR]The gameplay consisted of the Sierra's      AGI     parser. You control Roger with the arrow keys and type in commands that you want him to follow. What may seem antiquated today was a pretty big deal back then. The parser was a big step up from parsers in the earliest Sierra games, with a bigger vocabulary and ability to recognize more complex and a wider variety of commands.   At this point, Sierra games still allowed frequent and irreversible deaths. So saving often was the lesson of the day. Plus, it was entirely possible to miss an item and wind up being stuck later in the game. Major negatives for a game today, but back then it just added to the challenge.     [CR]Misc  [CR]SQII Cover  The gamebooklet of Space Quest II, besides a short walktrhough, also featured a nice comic with the adventures of Roger Wilco.   It also featured fake advertisements similar to the coupons you received upon buying the first Space Quest and had, like the game, manypop-culture parodies within.       SQII page 01SQII page 02SQII page 03SQII page 04     SQII page 05 SQII page 06 SQII page 07 SQII page 08                              [CR]Reception  [CR]The game was well received by critics and the public. It earned the number four spot in Sierra's Top 5 Bestsellers. Computer Gaming World was quoted as saying, "Though the game is similar to the original Space Quest, the addition of more detailed animation, more difficult puzzles, an improved parser (hurrah!), and greater scope makes a good game even better."  [CR]System Requirements  [CR]The game was released on both 3.5" and 5.25" floppy disks and had the following requirements:    8088/8086 CPU  256KB RAM CGA, EGA, Hercules, or Tandy/PCjr Graphics PC speaker or Tandy/PCjr Sound Card[CR]</plot>

				<plot>A spiritual descendant of War in Middle Earth, Spirit of Excalibur uses the same engine to tell the tale of what befell Camelot after the death of King Arthur. [CR]You play the role of the regent who holds the throne while chaos spreads through Britain. The game is broken into a number of episodes, which carry the overall plot of trying to restore Arthur's kingdom to some semblance of what it once was. Early episodes involve gathering the Knights of the Round Table, who have broken their fellowship. Because of their general distrust and dislike of certain other members, many knights will only return if asked by certain people and/or are given the correct incentive. Ultimately, you will wage a war on the sons of Mordred, who vie for the same throne their father did and stop the machinations of Morgan LeFay[CR]The game is played on two different levels. The first is a real time map where groups move about from place to place. At any time (or when a group encounters another or a place of importance) you can switch to a 'scene' level, which is a side-view of the group currently highlighted. Here you can pick up, drop, and manipulate quest items.</plot>

				<plot>Star Saga One is the first of an innovative role-playing trilogy (yet only two titles were released). It attempts to bring the atmosphere of pen &amp; paper RPG and Choose Your Own Adventure game books to the computer, while the more tedious task of book-keeping are made by the computer -- truly "Interactive Literature"..[CR]The game comes with two large fold-out maps and tokens to be moved around the map, as well as a dozen booklets containing text passages to be read when the game tells you to do so. (Much like the early Epyx Dunjonquest games.)[CR]When starting play, you can choose one to six players from preset character. The interesting thing is that the characters are meant to be played by separate players, sitting together in front of the computer, as in a pen &amp; paper RPG. The difference is that there is no party, as each player has different tasks and missions and moves around independent of the others.[CR]When playing, each player moves his token on the map, then enters the movements and actions into the program, which calculates all changes to character stats and inventory, calculates combat, and tells the player which text passage to read. While progressing, the players will make new discoveries, battle aliens, trade with other players and NPCs, and discover the plot of the game.</plot>

				<plot>The second entry in Masterplay's "Star Saga", combination science fiction role-playing with a strategy board game.  Gameplay allows for up to six players, who assume the role of pre-created characters (dossiers are provided in the game package).  A true merging of computerized and non-computerized RPG elements.[CR]The package also includes a fold-out poster map that acts as the game board, six colored stones for player markers, and a stack of game text booklets, which minimizes the number of game disks.</plot>

Watch out for torpedoes and Sonars.This was the first submarine simulation to include aircraft as opponents. You can choose to remain on the surface and defend yourself with your guns, or dive and hope to avoid the bomb and/or strafing that'll surely follow.</plot>

One of those creatures, named Franklin Snarl, traveled through the device to our reality and kidnapped Gramps, teleporting him into the crazy world of Tonetown. He hopes that Gramps will always remain asleep, which assures Snarl's own existence![CR]Now it's up to you, the hero of the game to travel to the alternate dimension of Tonetown and to rescue your grandfather. You interact with the environment by either typing in commands, or choosing one of the action icons available as interface. The game, therefore, combines text-based interaction with the more modern "point and click" approach.</plot>

Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears.  If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over.  Difficulty increases by dropping the pieces faster and faster over time.[CR]Tetris is a verifiable classic game, translated to well over 200 electronic and computer platforms.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Thexder was created by Hibiki Godai and Satoshi Uesaka, two programmers for Japanese developer Game Arts, and released in 1985. The game was massively popular and famously went on to sell over 500,000 copies in Japan. Because of this success, publisher/developer Sierra On-Line licensed the property for release in the United States. Sierra's ported version was released in 1987, and also became a best-seller. The game sold over one million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling computer games up until that time. Thexder was an important breakthrough title for the run-and-gun shooter genre, paving the way for titles such as Contra and Metal Slug.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Thexder Assault Vehicle is a "hyper dual-armor robot-jet transformer" (which basically means it can transform between robot and fighter jet modes). Equipped with heat-seeking lasers, a special shield system, and touch controlled flight mechanisms, Thexder is the ultimate fighting machine. There is only one Thexder in existence, and the protagonist is at its control.As the game opens, Thexder becomes locked in a mysterious facility with no means of escape. The mission is to survive all 16 levels and disable the central computer, which creates the evil creatures that dwell in this forbidden world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each level is a massive side-scrolling map filled with obstacles, enemies, and various maze-like twists and turns. Play always begins on the far left side of the map and ends on the far right. The goal is simple: get from the beginning to the end whilst still having energy.The Thexder Assault Vehicle can transform between two modes at any time: robot and jet. In robot mode, it can fire heat-seeking lasers to destroy enemies and obstacles. Although it has the ability to jump, Thexder's robot form is generally less mobile than its jet counterpart and therefore can't access certain areas of the level. In fighter jet mode, lasers can only be fired in a straight line, making the vehicle much less useful in combat. However, the jet's increased mobility allows it to reach areas that are higher and/or smaller than the robot's larger size would otherwise allow. To be successful, players need to master the balance between these two vehicle modes.In addition to its offensive capabilities, Thexder is also equipped with an energy shield. At any time, players can choose to engage the shield by sacrificing a percentage of their current energy level. The shield provides invulnerability, but decreases with time and with each hit taken from an enemy. Completing a level without using the shield awards a sizable bonus to the "ENMAX" (the total possible energy points that are available to Thexder). Since later levels become much more difficult, it is important to have as much ENMAX as possible. Because of this, strategic use of the shield is essential for success.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Thexder is comprised of 16 levels, which become increasingly complex and/or difficult as the game goes on. The first four levels take place within some sort of ship or cargo hold, and are generally not too difficult. The next three levels (5-7) shift location to a series of underground caverns, where the enemies begin to become more difficult. Levels 8 through 12 mark a return to the earlier area, only this time the maps are significantly more maze-like and feature even tougher enemies. The final stretch features a quick return to the caverns (levels 13-15) which culminates in a confrontation with the central computer in level 16.Each level contains a number of enemies and secret areas. Enemies can do serious damage to the vehicle and should typically be avoided or destroyed. However, there are a number of special creature types which, when destroyed, award increases to Thexder's ENMAX level. These special creatures are typically hidden away in secret areas, which can be uncovered with creative use of the laser. Finding as many of these ENMAX-increasing creatures as possible is critical.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]There is no traditional "ending" to the game. Completing all 16 levels just resets the game at level 1.The title screen music is Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata".The Tandy version of Thexder is arguably the best, as it features 16-color 320x200 resolution graphics and full 3-channel sound.The TRS-80 Color Computer version of the game only contains five levels. The size was reduced to fit onto a 32 kB ROM cartridge (instead of a 720 kB floppy disk).[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Third Courier is set in the era of the 'cold war', and the action takes place in Germany. The player is an American spy, and his mission is to recover stolen NATO defense plans.[CR]You start off in your apartment, which contains a computer, bugging equipment and an answerphone, as well as useful items such as money and a passport. A compass on screen is used to move around, with symbols appearing on the left and right of the status screen to indicate when something important is to the west or east of you. [CR]You will have to explore the city streets, with the aid of taxis and the Autobahn. Talk to important people and buy key objects, and then sneak around spying on anyone who seems suspicious. Encounters with enemy agents, muggers and tramps can turn violent; when they do, use your gun quickly to ensure they are shot first.</plot>

				<plot>Flight simulation specialists Digital Integration turned their attention to helicopter flight in this recreation of the AH-64 Apache. All the controls are realistically simulated, so the airspeed is dependent on the height of the vehicle, and you can move horizontally using the rudder option as well as rolling left and right. If using a Sinclair joystick interface you can use both ports to have all these controls accessible on dual joysticks, just like the real thing. Either way, a full instrument panel allows monitoring of these.You are armed with cannons, rockets and anti-tank missiles, each of which has its target set up independently, but only one can be loaded at once. Flight options include day/night, clear/cloudy and air turbulence on/off, allowing beginners and experts to find a suitable setting. Scenery includes trees, mountains and pylons, while enemy targets include helicopters, turrets and tanks.</plot>

				<plot>TrianGO is a variation of the board game Go that is played on a hexagon shaped board. The board is composed of 21 lines which cross to form triangles. The lines intersect to create 55 points where players can place their stones. The game is available for up to four players who take turns placing stones on the board. The aim is to capture the stones of the opponents by creating triangles. A triangle is created when three stones are positioned so that they can be connected with straight lines. All of the stones that are located within the triangle can then be captured if the player chooses to. When making a capture, both the player's own stones and those of the opponents are removed from the board. The player's own stones can be brought back into play while the opponents' are permanently out. To win the game the player has to become the last one still able to make a move (due to still having stones left).</plot>

				<plot>Another game using the graphical adventure interface found in D&#233;j&#224; Vu and Shadowgate, Uninvited comes with a "horror" theme.While driving on a lonely road at night, a strange figure blocks your vision causing you to swerve and crash your car. When you regain consciousness, you find that your brother is missing (in the NES-Version it's your sister who is missing). The only place he could have gone is a creepy old mansion which looms in front of you. With nowhere else to go, you enter the mansion in search of your brother. It turns out the mansion once belonged to an old wizard and his apprentice, and somehow it has become infested with the Undead.</plot>

				<plot>Three Rings for the-Elven kings under the sky,Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their hall of stone,Nine for mortal men doomed to die,One for the Dark Lord on his throneIn the land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and the darkness bind themIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.September 23, 1418 s.r. Frodo Baggins receives a letter from Gandalf the Grey, telling him to leave at once for Rivendell and to keep an eye out for a friend on the road by the name of Strider. He also warns that the servants of the Enemy are in pursuit and have taken the guise of riders in black.J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth is the 16-bit game with additional adventuring features compared to the 8-bit version, loosely depicting the events of the One Ring from the Shire to Mt. Doom. The game starts with the three hobbits: Frodo, Sam, and Pippin surrounded by nine individual units of Nazgul near the Shire. Although the first task is to travel to Rivendell, the player is free to decide how heroes and armies progress, despite the in-game conventional storyline. Victory is attained by successfully sending the ring bearer to Mt. Doom - how this accomplished is completely up to the player. Additionally, any hero including Frodo may die during combat. If the ring bearer dies during combat, a new ring bearer (if they survive the encounter) will be appointed to carry the One Ring. If the enemy gains possession of the One Ring is taken by the enemy, they will attempt to reach Barad-Dur, Sauron's fortress in the heart of Mordor, which will result in the player's defeat. The player will also lose if the enemy manages to seize three major allied citadels. Gameplay is divided in accordance to the three different map levels used:Full Map LevelConsists of the whole map of Middle Earth on one screen. All heroes and armies will be shown as colored dots; blue as allied units, green as neutral units, and red as enemy units, as well as general terrain and regional displays. All forces are in the game are viewable as no fog of war feature is in effect.Campaign LevelMost gameplay features of the war takes place at this level. This map offers more detail of locations and units; all locations such as towns, citadels, ruins, etc., may be viewed from here; characters are displayed as figured and armies as badges. Large armies will be shown as a shield, indicating the unit type as well as the shield background signifying the unit's country of origin. Although at the start of the game various character and armies are viewable across the map, only flashing units may be issued orders by the player.Combat encounters for armies also commence at this level, which will prompt a new window where the player may opt to enter a battle or ignore the event. Combat orders consist of four commands: charge, engage, withdraw, and retreat. The battle when all units of either side is completely destroyed or retreats.Animation LevelAnimated encounters for characters take place at the level, either for story or combat-related events. Random encounters will prompt a window to be opened and the player may opt to go there or ignore the event. Objects, such as armor, weapons, and other equipment are also viewable and may only be manipulated at this level (e.g. equip, use, etc.). Some units of the West require certain items before their units may be mobilized.</plot>

				<plot>The sequel to Moebius, Windwalker combines role-playing with side-view beat 'em up gameplay. You are accompanied by Moebius on a quest to master the martial arts.Hostile persons including thieves, guards and assassins will be encountered; you fight them in real time using moves such as cartwheels and flying kicks. This can be played either as a continuous battle, or with short breaks to catch your composure.The role-playing elements eschew the Ultima-style plan view in favor of a pseudo-3D system. Deism and Shamanism are just some of the included magic disciplines. Magical vehicles help you get around the 100 landscapes more quickly, although you spend much time on foot. The game takes place in a fully active universe of characters such as villagers and giant beetles, all getting about their business within a day/night cycle and variable weather.</plot>

				<plot>World Tour Golf lets you play over a dozen well known courses, including Augusta and Pebble Beach. A split screen gives you an overhead view of the hole and a 3-D view. The control uses multiple button presses to set pace and draw/fade - fortunately a Driving Range is included to practice on. When you select a club, its range is superimposed on the view, making planning shots easier. Wind, pin placement and even weather conditions must be considered as you play your shot.  Also included is a course architect for creating new courses or modifying existing ones.</plot>

				<plot>Aliens have taken over the three moons orbiting your home planet, and your mission is to blow them up (not just the aliens, but the entire moons!)[CR]Each moon contains 4 levels incorporating several gameplay modes and perspectives.  The first level is a 1st-person 3D sim as you pilot your ship over the moon's surface looking for the entrance to a cave.  Level 2 is a side-view scrolling shooter where you explore the cave in search of bombs.  Level 3 is similar to level 2 except it takes place underwater.  The final level is a top-down grid-based maze shooter as you try to plant the bombs and escape before they explode.</plot>

				<plot>Using the mouse to determine the direction and strength of your putts, you must navigate 9 tricky holes of crazy / mini golf. Try to putt into holes protected by bouncing hamburgers, windmills, etc.  Courses have several twists; one is a mad scientists's lab, another is a pinball table.  The final hole is especially bizarre, themed around energy.You start with 3 strokes, but get the par for each hole added on, if you reach it in time -  run out of strokes, and your game is over. You can earn bonus strokes by finding hidden bonuses and by completing courses quickly.  Up to 4 players at a time can take part in this game, with anyone badly over par being eliminated as the game progresses. </plot>
