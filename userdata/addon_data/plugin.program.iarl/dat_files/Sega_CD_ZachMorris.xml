			<emu_comment>Sega CD List by Zach Morris.[CR]The Sega CD, released as the Mega-CD in most regions outside North America, is a CD-ROM accessory for the Sega Genesis video game console designed and produced by Sega as part of the fourth generation of video game consoles. The add-on was released in 1991. The Sega CD lets the user play CD-based games and adds extra hardware functionality, such as a faster central processing unit and graphic enhancements. It can also play audio CDs and CD+G discs.[CR]Seeking to create an add-on device for the Genesis, Sega developed the unit to read compact discs as its storage medium. The main benefit of CD technology was greater storage capacity, which allowed for games to be nearly 320 times larger than their Genesis cartridge counterparts.[CR]Developer:  Epyx / Atari[CR]Manufacturer:  Sega[CR]CPU:  MC68000 @ 12.5 MHz[CR]Memory:  4 Mbit[CR]Graphics:  Custom ASIC[CR]Sound:  Ricoh RF5C164[CR]Display:  320 Ã— 224[CR]Media:  Disc[CR]Max Controllers:  2</emu_comment>

				<title_clean>3 Ninjas Kick Back</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]3 Ninjas Kick Back is a 1994 action-platformer game for the Super Nintendo,  Sega Genesis and Sega CD. The player, as either Rocky (the green-garbed older brother, who uses a staff in-game), Colt (the blue-garbed middle brother, who uses a sword in-game) or Tum Tum (the yellow-garbed youngest brother, who uses a pair of sais), must make their way through a series of levels using their speed, reflexes and ninja skills. The game emphasizes climbing as a mechanic, allowing the player character to hold onto branches and swinging vines by holding up while jumping. From these vantage points, the player can progress in the stage or find hidden bonuses.3 Ninjas Kick Back is based on the 1994 movie of the same name, which was the second 3 Ninjas movie to be released. The plot concerns the theft of a dagger that was awarded to the trio's grandfather, Mori, for winning a tournament in Japan 50 years ago. The trio eventually head to Japan to track it down, fighting the goons of Koga (an embittered runner-up in the tournament) along the way.The Sega CD version of the game was bundled together with the 1992 SNES/Genesis licensed platformer Hook, which was also based on a family movie distributed by TriStar Pictures.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>AH-3 Thunderstrike is a helicopter sim/shooter. You will pilot the AH-3 over 10 operations all over the world. Each operation is composed of several missions, such as destroying tanks, or destroying bridges, or escorting trucks, and so on.[CR]Thunderstrike's graphics consist of scaled sprites arranged to create a 3D environment. It makes use of the Sega CD's scaling and rotation hardware to create this effect with a smooth frame rate.</plot>

				<plot>In the year 2500, humanity is attacked by the alien Gurzons. The Earth Defense Force doesn't stand a chance, and whole cities are laid to waste by the evil invaders. There is still hope, however: enemies of the Gurzons from the planet Prism offer their help. If just a few EDF pilots can make it to Prism, they will be provided with the ultimate weapon which may turn the tide: the A/X 101 system. Controlling one of four starfighters launched on the mission, it is the player's job to break the orbital blockade, make it to Prism and then take the fight to the enemy.[CR]The game is an on-rails shooter, with gameplay seen from a first-person cockpit perspective. The player's ship moves automatically through pre-rendered space and planetary environments and only the targeting crosshair can be moved freely. Laser Cannons and Fusion Warheads are available to hit the numerous enemies. Lasers have unlimited ammunition but need a few moments time to recharge. The warheads function as smart bombs and clear the screen of enemies, but are available only in limited supply. They are restocked when reaching a certain score. The ship's energy shield functions as a life bar.[CR]Between the shooting levels, there are transitional cutscenes, pre-rendered in the same way as the actual gameplay.</plot>

				<title_clean>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Eye Of The Beholder</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Eye of the Beholder (EotB) is the first game in the  AD&amp;D-based  Eye of the Beholder trilogy published by SSI as a part of their "Legend Series." It was developed by Westwood Associates, the same developers that would go on to become Westwood Studios, and published by SSI. It was notable at the time for its use of lush 3D graphics, extensive puzzles, and animated monster encounters along with the degree of interactivity that players had within its dungeons such as flipping levers, weighing down pressure plates with stones, and its real-time interface. The game pits a party of adventurers against the machinations of a beholder known as Xanathar: a ruthless criminal hiding deep beneath the port city of Waterdeep.The game is a licensed TSR product, and implements the  2nd Edition AD&amp;D ruleset and features the  Forgotten Realms campaign setting that had been used in previous SSI AD&amp;D games such as the Gold Box series. In the Forgotten Realms setting, Waterdeep is one of the greatest cities of the era, the so-called "Crown of the North," a vital trading hub whose wealth has seen its environs and its influence expand rapidly throughout the Sword Coast region. The secretive Lords of Waterdeep, the unseen council that both watches and protects the city from fell schemes discovered outside and within its own walls, maintain the tenuous balance of power between the factions there in order to ensure its survival. Only one of these Lords is ever shown as the "public" face in order to act as a liaison between the people and themselves.Copy protection takes the form of challenge questions that the player will occasionally be asked during the course of the game that would refer to a specific word within the game manual. Copies were encouraged in order to preserve the original disks. The console versions did not include this aspect.The manual is also notable for including a great deal of information concerning the monsters, classes, and weapons that could be encountered within the game, all adhering to the 2nd Edition AD&amp;D ruleset. Experience tables and other pieces of information are located in the back of the manual. The following manuals would be similar in design, although the monsters described would be changed from one title to the next. The manual for Eye of the Beholder also contains a rough map of Waterdeep as well as a historical primer on its significance.The game was ported to consoles in 1994, including a  SNES version by  Capcom and a  Sega CD version by  Sega. While Capcom's version is a more faithful reproduction of the original, the Sega CD version was an enhanced  remake famous for its CD soundtrack composed by  Yuzo Koshiro. Departing from the  chiptune medieval music of the the original PC version, Koshiro's Sega CD soundtrack was one of the first  ambient  electronica soundtracks.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Eye of the Beholder's story begins with a meeting called by Piergeiron, the current Lord of Waterdeep, with the party. He hands them a letter describing a threat that his friend, the Archmage, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, has detected witin the city and requests that the party investigate the disturbances and, if necessary, deal with them in whatever method they see fit. They are given an official commission from the city and are quickly ushered to the sewers where they believe the threat to be located. However, their unseen nemesis has been waiting for them and the only way out is suddenly blocked by a thundering avalanche of rocks and stone, forcing the player to delve deeper below the streets of Waterdeep and to a confrontation with their foe.After a series of traps and challenges that the party encounters during the adventure, they come face to face with Xanathar, a beholder who is also acting as the major crime lord of Waterdeep who has been plotting his ascension to power. After a climactic battle in which Xanatar is defeated, the party is celebrated as heroes of the city.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game uses a  grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90&#176; turns and movement spaces. Within the ever-present interface, a small window on the upper left quadrant of the screen displayed the world as in the first with the party listed on the right. A text box on the bottom part of the screen displays various messages while a compass is also shown when outside of combat. Random enemy encounters provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes. Everything in the interface is mouse-driven.Party setup and character selection are left entirely up to the player and many of the mechanisms and options available would remain unchanged through the next two iterations of the series. The party would always remain limited to six characters.RacesSix races are available for players to choose from and would be the first step in creating a new batch of characters. Gender has no bearing on a character's performance aside from making available the appropriate portraits during character creation. Many of the steps utilized in this part of the game would continue to act as the standard setup throughout the series.In keeping with the 2nd Edition AD&amp;D ruleset, each race has its own set of restrictions concerning both what classes are available to them such as how far they can advance in certain ones. Racial modifiers can also affect their efficiency in certain professions. Human: As in most RPGs, their statistics and abilities are fairly average across the board with no distinctive bonuses.Elf: Fair haired, fair skinned, and more agile than humans, their specialties are focused on both magic and war although they tend to do better as spellcasters. They have a bonus to dexterity and the use of bows along with long or short swords. They are highly resistant to charm or sleep spells. Dwarf: Short, gruff, and strong, they are renowned for their smithing skills as well as their combat abilities. Being a somewhat non-magical race, they have good resistances against many spells and even poisons. Halflings: Short in stature, friendly to a fault, and generally good natured, halflings are also innately resistant to spells. They're also dexterous making them decent fighters and sticky fingered rogues.Half Elves: They have no racial modifiers but are somewhat resistant to sleep and charm spells. However, because of their longer lifespans, they are able to multi-class with a greater number of combinations than other races and are decent fighters. Gnome: Good as clerics, thieves, and even fighters, they are also fairly magic resistant as their distant cousins, the dwarves, are.ClassesAs with many RPGs, the game offers a choice to the player to select from a variety of classes that they could use to first create their characters and, ultimately, their parties with.Throughout the entire  Eye of the Beholder series, six  classes would be made available to players to choose from, each with its own set of restrictions, although certain races have the ability to multi-class meaning that they can become a combination of classes. Each classes require certain prime requisites, or ability scores, to be at certain values before that character can become part of that class.Fighter: The consummate fighter, they can use nearly every weapon that they find. They can use magical weapons, rings, but can cast no spells. As they gain levels, they also gain speed which enables them to attack more often in combat. The prime requisite for this class is strength and any race and alignment can be a member.Paladin: These are elite fighters dedicated to smiting evil wherever it may be and will not join a party that has evil members. They are immune to disease, have increased resistances to spell effects and poison, and can heal other characters with their "laying on of hands" ability. At higher levels, they are also able to turn undead and can cast certain clerical spells. They also have a persistent aura around them that acts as a negative affect on evil creatures that come too close. Only humans with good scores in both Strength and Charisma can become this class.Thieves: A high dexterity is a prime requisite for this class and they are restricted in wearing only leather-type armor and in using a limited number of weapons. Any race can be this class and it is considered an important one to have in the game to avoid getting the party killed whenever a trap is found.Rangers: They can use any weapon as a fighter can and can even dual wield melee weapons without any penalty, but only if they are not wearing heavy armor. Humans, elves, and half-elves are the only races that are allowed in the game that can be a part of this class.Cleric: They are holy warriors that can fight with a number of weapons and wear armor while casting divine spells against their enemies. Ideal for dealing with the undead as well as healing the party. Wisdom is the prime requisite for this class and any race can be a part of it.Mages: The spellcasters of the Realm, what they lack in armor and weapons expertise are made up for in the spells that they can weave. Unlike several other RPG systems of the time that utilized spell points, mages in AD&amp;D have to memorize a set number of spells in order to store and use them at a later time. Once those memorized spells are used up, the mage must take time to memorize another batch. Intelligence is the prime requisite for this class and as they gain in level, they also gain extra slots that can be used to store memorized spells. Humans, Elves, and Half-Elves can become mages in the game.AlignmentAD&amp;D along with many other PnP RPGs at the time makes extensive use of an  alignment system to determine a character's worldview and how they conduct themselves within society which would also be reflected in EotB's mechanics as well as that of its following sequels.World View:Lawful: A character will work within the lawsNeutral: A character will move between valuing a society and valuing an individual.Chaotic: A character will choose the good of the individual above that of everything else.Ethics:Good: The character tries to act in a moral and upstanding manner.Neutral: A character leans towards evaluating 'situational ethics' depending on the circumstances.Evil: A character acts without regard for others or in an overly malignant manner.For example, a Lawful Good character would be by-the-book when it came to upholding the good in society while a Chaotic Good character would be more willing to bend the rules in order to provide the same. A Lawful Evil character might hold their word as their bond and be loathe to break it for anyone, but would only give it if confronted by someone whose power they respect or as a part of one of their fell schemes. As interesting as this was, the game did not make an extensive use of the potential that this system could bring to an RPG.AttributesCharacter  attributes would help determine what classes were available for certain characters and how well they would perform in them. In 2nd Edition AD&amp;D, attribute scores of 18 were considered the highest possible in a natural sense, although racial bonuses and magical effects/enhancements in the form of spells or items would be able to raise them higher either temporarily or permanently in more rare cases. These are set as far as the game was concerned. Leveling improved a character's HP (hit points) and general abilities, but their base statistics would almost never change.EotB and its  following sequels would also allow the player to modify statistics during character creation with any number of changes that were limited only by the maximum level a particular attribute could be as determined by race.Strength: This determines the amount of physical damage that a character can inflict. With a strength statistic of 18, an additional variable is added to indicate exceptional strength as a percentage shown as 18/23.Constitution: A character's health and toughness is determined by this. In AD&amp;D, this has other effects outside of simply determining the HP amount gained after every level, such as a character's resistance to certain physical effects.Intelligence: A vital attribute for mages as they learn spells.Dexterity: Characters with a high dexterity tend to be nimble and agile improving their AC (armor class) which measures how hard they are to hit in combat. Important for every class, but more so with others such as fighters and thieves. With a score of 16 or higher, fighters can negate some of the penalties levied against them for using dual weapons.Charisma: This determines how attractive or repulsive a character is to everyone around them, whether it is in how they carry themselves in conversation or appear in public. Important for paladins.Wisdom: A character's innate ability to judge situations and make the best choices. It is also important in spell resistance and particularly key for clerics. Higher wisdom scores above 13 also translate into extra spells that clerics can utilize.[CR]Combat[CR]Fighting in the game is handled through random encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. The front ranks, determined by the two characters at the top of the party list, can engage in melee combat. All other characters must resort to ranged weapons or spells in order to join in the fight. An onscreen menu guides their actions and right clicking with the mouse on the appropriate icon, such as a warrior's sword, would cause them to act.Camping is available for the player to rest and heal the party, memorize spells, and save the game when necessary.[CR]NPC Companions[CR]As well as creating a party of player characters, during the adventure beneath the city of Waterdeep it is possible to find other adventurers who will offer their services to help the player characters in defeating Xanathar.TOD UPHILLTod is a Halfling Thief who accidentally fell down a sewer grate in the city of Waterdeep.

				<title_clean>Adventures Of Batman &amp; Robin</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin is a variety of different games. The SNES version is a traditional side-scrolling action game whereas the Genesis version is a two player game that plays like a shooter. But instead of using guns, Batman and Robin uses Batarangs and other projectiles to take out their foes. The Sega CD version consists of just Batmobile levels.[CR]The SNES Version[CR]The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin was originally titled "Batman: The Animated Series" after the show. But since the show got a name change, the game was delayed and then renamed to what it is called today and Robin was added as an NPC. Despite his appearance in the game, Robin is not a playable character. Each level is based off episodes of the series and shared dialogue and moments from them. Before each level Batman must choose from a variety of different weapons to take with him.The SNES version had 8 levels:Level 1: Amused to DeathThe Joker and Harley Quinn broadcast a television message to Batman inviting him to meet them at The Joker's Funhouse.Boss: The JokerBased on the episode(s): Christmas with the Joker, Be A ClownLevel title cardLevel 2: No Green PeaceBizarre things are occurring at the forest in Gotham City suburban district there's only one person who would do such a thing. In this level, Batman refuses to use his fists, Bat Stars and Bat Explosives since there are only female enemies.Boss: Poison IvyBased on the episode(s): Pretty Poison, Eternal YouthLevel title cardLevel 3: Fowl PlayThere has been a break-in at the Gotham City Museum and it's up to Batman &amp; Robin to find the person responsible for this. Unfortunately, Robin is not a playable character in this level.Boss: PenguinBased on the episode(s): TBCLevel title cardLevel 4: Tale of the CatBatman is doing his nightly routine in the streets of Gotham City when he stumbles upon a familiar cat burglar lurking around.Boss: CatwomanBased on the episode(s): The Cat and The Claw part ILevel title cardLevel 5: Trouble in TransitTwo-Face has just robbed a bank and is making his escape. Make him pay!Boss: Two-FaceBased on the episode(s): Two-Face part IILevel title cardLevel 6: Perchance to ScreamBoss: ScarecrowBased on the episode(s): Nothing To FearLevel title cardLevel 7: Riddle Me ThisBoss: The RiddlerBased on the episode(s): If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?, What Is Reality?Level title cardLevel 8: The GauntletBosses: The JokerPenguinCatwomanScarecrowClayfaceMan-BatBased on the episode(s): Trial (loosely based)Level title card[CR]The Genesis/ Mega Drive Version[CR]The Sega Genesis version is a run 'n' gun game. Instead of using guns Batman and Robin use Batarangs. Levels are swarming with enemies and the player must "shoot" them to defeat them. If they get up close to the player then the heroes will either punch or kick them instead of throwing a Batarang. In some levels the player flies in a Batwing moving from the left to the right shooting down anything in their path. The plot features Mr. Freeze wanting to freeze Gotham . In the process he releases Joker, Two-Face, and Mad Hatter out of Arkham Asylum an attempt to distract Batman and Robin from his intentions. The Genesis version consists of four levels:Happy Birthday to Me!Bosses:Harley's RobotHarley QuinnJokerA Two-Sided StoryBosses:Two Face's AirshipLarge ShipTwo-FaceTea Time!Bosses:Giant CatGiant DollMad-HatterSnow in July?Boss:Mr. Freeze[CR]The Sega CD Version[CR]Pimp my ride!The Sega CD version is a 3D driving game with levels comprising only of driving the Batmobile and Batplane from point A to point B - shooting enemy vehicles along the way. The CD version is well known for having over 16 minutes of original animated footage created purely for the game with no involvement from Warner Bros. Animation. These cutscenes would later be known as 'The Lost Episode' from the animated series. All the principal voice actors from the series like Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Loren Lester, Arleen Sorkin and John Glover reprise their roles. The only thing missing from the source material is the original score by Danny Elfman and Shirley Walker. The game instead used its own "synth rock" style music.Enemies:Poison IvyThe RiddlerHarley QuinnThe JokerRupert ThorneClayface[CR]</plot>

Use of the Vulcan machine gun and missiles, as well as a turbo boost from the After Burner make for an exhilarating, though sometimes chugging flight. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of  4,6,5,7 adding, "...After Burner has long been the forefather to arcade dogfighting, and After Burner III is no exception.  This is a welcome addition to my Sega CD lineup".  A second reviewer though disagreed stating, "...the music is good but even the opening animations are unimpressive, with minor scaling and rotation.  The game play needs some work...". [CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The game was also known as Strike Fighter, which it was known as in the Japanese arcades before being adapted to become an After Burner sequel.[CR]</plot>

Burning with a cold dark flame at the core of these reactors is the rare, extraterrestrial element, "Meridium", which was discovered by the Interplanetary Mining Corporation (IMC) on a misbegotten planet known as "Mandlebrot's World", located eight light years from Earth. A colony is soon established on Mandlebrot and it's manned by a small team of miners using the latest robotics mining and defense machines - the Battlebots. But when MOSES (Multicameral Organic Synergistic Energized System), the colony's bio-computerized operating system, is infected with a virus by a saboteur from a rival mining company, BioMechanical Incorporated (BioMech), all hell breaks loose. MOSES turns the Battlebots on the colonists. The Battlebots imprison the colonists and transform Mandlebrot into a heavily armed fortress. IMC immediately dispatches the BATTLECORPS combat-hardened veterans of the Corporate Wars. These veterans are downloaded into their Armordillo-Class, Bipedal Attack Machines (BAMs) and they must now take back the planet...[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bill Walsh College Football is a 1993 college football game for the Super Nintendo, Sega CD and Genesis. It is functionally similar to EA Sports's more famous football series, Madden NFL, and contains many similar features. The player can select to play a single exhibition game, start a whole season, take part in the '93 playoffs or play famous playoffs with historical teams. The latter two modes have set team ups.Featured TeamsAlabamaArizonaBoston (Massachusetts) College Station (Texas)ColoradoColumbus (Ohio)FloridaGeorgiaHawaiiKansasMiami (Florida)MichiganNebraskaProvo (Utah)Pullman (Washington)Raleigh (North Carolina)South CarolinaSouth Bend (Indiana)Stanford (California)State College (Pennsylvania)Syracuse (New York)Tallahassee (Florida)TennesseeWashingtonIt also includes the following "historical" teams:Alabama '78Atlanta '90 (Georgia)Auburn '83 (Alabama)Baton Rouge '87 (Louisiana)Boston '84Clemson '81 (South Carolina)Colorado '90Columbus '79Florida '84Georgia '80Los Angeles '82 (California)Miami '91Michigan '85Nebraska '83Oklahoma '85Pittsburgh '80 (Pennsylvania)Provo '84South Carolina '79South Bend '88State College '86Tallahassee '87Tennessee '85Texas '81Washington '91[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand gave the review score of 7 out of ten writing, "...the idea of making this with college football teams is almost irrelevant, since it is almost identical to all other football games out there". Later in the two sentence review he appears to contradict himself when he adds, "...game play is solid, just as you would expect from EA, making it a must for football fans".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>According to Blackhole Assault, the 22nd century sees earth technology advance to the point where exploration of the immediate solar system is not only possible, but necessary due to resource constraints. Humans are attempting to harvest the resources of the entire solar system but have met with trouble from alien invaders. It is up to a small force of humans who recognize and understand the threat to confront the aliens head on.[CR]The weapon of choice in this game is the Cybernetic Anthropomorphized Machine, or C.A.M. The C.A.M. is a large robot that fights 1-on-1 against alien robots. All of the gameplay in Blackhole Assault revolves around single-round, 1-on-1 robot fighting action. There are 10 backdrops against which to beat up robots, including various planets and moons around the solar system.[CR]The game has 4 different modes. The main story mode is Operation BHA. The exhibition mode allows players to customize matches down to the robots each player will use and the backdrop to play on. The exhibition mode can be configured to allow one or even both fighters to be controlled by the computer. Further, the game has tournament and league modes.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bram Stoker's Dracula is a 1993 video game released as a tie-in based on the Francis Ford Coppola movie of the same name. In the game, the player takes on the role of Jonathan Harker, who must stop the vampire Dracula. Versions of the game were released for a multitude of platforms ranging from the Amiga and NES to the Sega CD and PC.There were numerous variations between each version, though they all played similarly and shared the protagonist Jonathan Harker.NES, Game Boy, Game Gear and Sega Master SystemThe 8-bit and portable versions of the game skewed closer to standard platformers than the other console versions, with floating platforms and other standard platformer obstacles.SNES and GenesisThe 16-bit versions were action games that focused more on combat and adventure game elements than platforming. The sprite used for Harker was larger, and the games had more enemies to face down.Sega CD and AmigaSimilar to the SNES and Genesis, these versions were more action-oriented. They included FMV cutscenes from the movie and digitized backgrounds.DOSThe Bram Stoker's Dracula for PC MS-DOS systems was a first-person shooter, taking after games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D (or Blood and Heretic, which share similar gothic horror settings).[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Dalai Llama (bad pun or what?) has organised a martial arts contest for animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself. [CR]Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat 'em up across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown. [CR]During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a "taunt" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen. [CR]Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player. [CR]The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.[CR]In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though.</plot>

				<plot>A third-person driving and shooting game, based on a popular "alternative" comic series by Mark Shultz. The game is a rail-shooter, similar to Rocket Science's earliest game Loadstar.[CR]You find yourself in the so-called Xenozoic Age - after a cataclysm in 2020 A.D., mankind was forced to hide beneath the surface. Once it could come out again, it found the world terribly changed, with dinosaurs roaming freely once again. A mysterious mutant-like race, called the Grith, believe the cataclysm was caused by the upsetting of the natural balance. Now, the leader of the restored City in the Sea, Scharnhorst, is using old technology and disrupting the balance again. The Girth chose you, Jack Tenrec, and your partner Hannah Dundee, to rid the world of Scharnhorst. And you get to do it in a red '53 Cadillac with mounted machine guns.[CR]While you're at the task, you must battle hungry, mean dinosaurs, but also be careful not to upset the balance of nature. Also, try not to upset your volcanic-energy fueled caddy by hitting too much obstacles along the way.[CR]Graphics are a mix of 3D objects and environments and comic-like 2D sprites, but captures much of the original comic book's style.</plot>

				<plot>The first football (soccer to you Americans; how come your game called football features virtually no kicks, and even then only from 2 designated players?) game to challenge the supremacy of the Kick Off series. The graphical view is from a distance overhead, making the players small on screen but making around half the pitch visible. [CR]The basic control system involves loose control, making running with the ball (dribbling in football parlance) a skill to master, and putting the emphasis on  one-touch passing, which can be easily performed by tapping the fire button.[CR]The game features customisable league and cup competitions as well as pre-set ones including the 1992 European Championships. There are 168 teams in total, 40 European nations, the 64 top club sides, and 64 custom teams with names ranging from self-indulgent to comical, and their details are fully editable. At club and country level, each team has 3 star players who are more gifted that the others, use them wisely.</plot>

				<title_clean>Chuck Rock</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chuck Rock is a prehistoric-themed platformer starring the eponymous caveman Chuck on a quest to rescue his wife from a jealous rival. Chuck's main form of attack is a stomach bump with a limited range, but he is also able to take advantage of rocks littering the stages to attack enemies from afar. He can also use these rocks to create platforms to higher areas he cannot reach by jumping normally. While most dinosaurs are hostile some, like the wading brachiosaurs and certain pteranodons, will assist Chuck by taking him to new areas of the stage.UK developers Core Design originally created Chuck Rock for the Atari ST and Amiga computer platforms, and it was subsequently published on many home consoles of the era by Sony Imagesoft and Virgin Interactive in Europe and the US. It is perhaps best remembered for its rock n' roll theme tune. It was followed up with a direct sequel starring Chuck's son Chuck Jr., called Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, and BC Racers, a spin-off cart racer game.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The story in this Chuck Rock game takes up a little while after the end of the first game.  As you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter.  Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married.  Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him.  Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad![CR]The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.</plot>

				<plot>Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the Stallone film of the same name. Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from avalanches. [CR]Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.[CR]The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.</plot>

It is an "on rails" style shooter with the player controlling only the aiming of the shooting but not the direction of the helicopter.  [CR]Your job is to shoot down the enemies as you are flown through footage of New York streets, the Statue of Liberty, the Atlantic Ocean, Italy, the Grand Canyon and finally, the treacherous corners and return fire of the enemy's stronghold on Easter Island.[CR]There is no background music to go along with the sound effects.  The levels are fairly short with a total game run through possible in about 20 minutes.</plot>

				<title_clean>Dark Wizard</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Dark Wizard is a tactics-based, fantasy role-playing game developed by  Sega for the  Sega CD. It was conceptualized by  Kenji Terada who was notable for his work as scenario writer for the first three  Final Fantasy games. Released in Japan in 1993 as Dark Wizard: Yomigaerishi Yami no Madoushi and in the United States in 1994, Dark Wizard features turn-based strategic combat played on a hex field map that progresses from one battle scenario to the next interspersed with brief cutscenes to advance the story. This single-player game also features an orchestral soundtrack and long animated sequences complete with voice-acting. The setting takes place in the once-peaceful lands of Cheshire now overrun by the demonic hordes of Velonese, a former wizard apprentice imbued with the powers of a dark god. The player chooses one of four characters who becomes the ruler of Cheshire to launch a counterattack from the remote kingdom of Quentin - the last stronghold under human control. The leader's task is to push back the invasion and liberate other kingdoms seized by the Demon Army. Each ruler has his or her own self-contained storyline and motivation for waging war against Velonese as well as unique powers, attributes and units available to them.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The gameplay in Dark Wizard largely involves the player taking command of a party comprised of warriors, priests, mages and summoned creatures against an opposing army of demons led by a powerful commander. Each side uses a turn to assign up to two actions per unit until the player manually ends the turn. These actions involve such choices as movement, or moving then attacking when in close enough proximity to a foe. Movement is governed by hex tiles on the battlefield. How far a unit can travel is determined by its ability to cross certain types of terrain based on its class and statistics. The objective in most scenarios is to vanquish the opposing commander as it is not mandatory to defeat all enemies on the map to win the battle. Units can only move to hexes that appear clear.Once a battle is won, several options open up. One of these is buying and selling equipment for troops all from within a handy menu. Another is to assemble a search party to seek out rare items, although members of this group will not be present for the subsequent battle. Troops can also be sent out to guard previously conquered maps as they can be retaken by the Demon Army. The option to advance to the next map is also available but is limited to land adjacent to the ruler's current location. As leader, the player is able to build an army from scratch and oversee its development. As long as the main character is situated on a castle, up to six units that are neutral or of the leader's own alignment can be hired or summoned per turn. Hirelings are all humanoids (dwarves, hobbits, elves and humans) who become warriors, mages and priests and are paid in gold with tax money collected from liberated castles and cities. The leader can also use magic points (MP) to summon a menagerie of creatures such as dragons, hydras, chimeras and griffins. Every unit grows in power by gaining experience points (EXP) through casting spells, inflicting damage, receiving damage, killing a foe or a combination of these actions. Once a unit accumulates enough experience points it will gain a level. When a certain level is reached (usually level five or ten), the unit is promoted to a more powerful class. Each of the alignments has its own unique class progression.Alignment is an important gameplay mechanic generally divided into three categories: Lawful, Neutral and Chaotic. It determines not only the types of units a leader can acquire and the weapons humanoid units can equip, but also adjusts their degree of power depending on the time of day. In the daytime, Lawful units gain a slight advantage and Chaotic units are slightly disadvantaged and the opposite is true of nighttime. A fourth alignment, Undead, is attributed to a number of units of the Demon Army as well as one of the main protaganists, the vampire Amon, and most of his summoned minions. Gameplay-wise, the Undead alignment essentially functions as Chaotic with principal differences being resistance to most spells, susceptibility to fire and the availability of certain creatures.   Speaking to everyone in town is never a bad thing. Ever.Reclaiming cities and castles plays a crucial role in sustaining the player's army. This is the primary means of maintaining a steady flow of income to insure all hirelings get paid, aside from selling various items to NPCs in cities. Each liberated city yields approximately 2 to 20 gold per turn while castles yield 20 to 100 gold depending on the leader's economic strength rating. During each battle, humanoid units are able to enter cities and interact with NPCs to buy or sell weapons, armor, potions and even alcoholic beverages. Speaking with NPCs allows the player to advance the plot, catch up on the latest gossip, or even accept side quests. Additionally, a sub-leader of which there are two for each main character can only be obtained through NPC dialogue. Sub-leaders are powerful characters in their own right secondary only to the ruler. [CR]Main Characters[CR]There are four main characters or rulers to choose from, each of whom has a reason for wanting to slaughter Velonese the eponymous Dark Wizard - whether it be a commendable fight for freedom or simply to prove one's superiority. Every leader will be joined by two sub-leaders who vary depending on which ruler is selected.   Armer IX - Lawful PrinceArmer IXThe noble prince who is the rightful heir to the throne of Cheshire after his father, Armer VIII, is killed in battle against the Demon Army. He is joined by a sorceress, Marie, and Dianna, a warrior.Robin - Lawful WarriorRobinConsidered the finest warrior in the land, Robin takes the reigns as ruler out of loyalty not only to Cheshire, but to her slain sovereign as well. She is joined by an old priest, Kail, and David, a mighty warrior.Krystal - Chaotic SorceressKrystalA sorceress tricked by Velonese to kill Armer VIII under false pretenses, Krystal will stop at nothing to sate her thirst for vengeance. She is joined by a warrior, Marcus, and Katrina, a priestess. Amon - Undead Vampire LordAmonVampire and lord of the undead, Amon refuses to acknowledge Velonese or even the dark god Arliman as masters of the night and vows to prove his point. He murders the king and assumes his form to take charge of the assault against the Demon Army. He is joined by a sorceress, Susan, and Andrew, a vampire hunter. [CR]Backstory [CR]    Three hundred years ago, the noble king Rishon ruled over the prosperous lands of Cheshire. At the time, the harmonious synergy between Sabrina, the goddess of daylight and Arliman, the god of night, reigned supreme. The people of Cheshire benefited greatly from the   abundance of life provided by both deities and the   wise leadership of their king. However, Rishon's high priest Zahark, sought to upset the balance of power and set a devious plan in motion.    Knowing full well the jealousy the dark god Arliman harbored for Sabrina's divine radiance, Zahark set out to use this to his advantage in his powergrab for Cheshire's throne. Using a forbidden spell to bring Arliman to life and grant him physical form, Zahark was rewarded with arcane powers to assist in the dark god's impending conquest.  Sensing the imminent threat, Sabrina acted swiftly and soon discovered who was responsible for the distressing break in peace. She appointed two renowned leaders to battle the demonic onslaught and granted each of them holy powers. One of these leaders was the beautiful and wise Armer, and the other a mighty warrior named Vian. Armer was charged with eliminating Zahark, while Vian was left with the monumental task of facing Arliman with the aid of the grand wizard Gilliam. In the heat of battle, Gilliam cast a powerful spell that encased Arliman into what became known as the Jewel of Darkness. Although the dark god was defeated, Vian disappeared and was never heard from again.   With the threat of eternal darkness across the land thwarted, the people looked toward a new leader as the great Rishon had been slain during the war. Armer, the celebrated heroine, ascended to the throne as ruler of Cheshire which ushered in a new era of peace. Heeding the wise edicts of Rishon, Armer presided justly over a once-again prosperous land. Meanwhile, Velonese, the head apprentice of the grand wizard Gilliam, began performing forbidden rituals of the dark arts in secret. He was eventually found out, and needed to be made an example for his grave indiscretions. Velonese was sentenced to solitude on the isle of Raven to forever guard the Jewel of Darkness that imprisoned the  malevolent god Arliman. Gilliam, being a wizard of tremendous power, possessed knowledge of the Spell of Immortality and cast it upon Velonese so that he may carry out his sentence for all eternity.  For three hundred years, the hatred Velonese held for the outside world festered as he finally discovered a means to draw upon the vile essence of Arliman from within the Jewel of Darkness. Using the forbidden knowledge which sentenced him to damnation in the first place, Velonese unleashed onto the world the powers he mastered during his excruciatingly lonesome captivity. With these unholy powers, four monstrous demon generals were spawned from the ribs of Velonese to lead his armies and decimate the lands of Cheshire as he prepares to free Arliman from the Jewel of Darkness. The unexpected ferocity of the Demon Army forced King Armer VIII's legions to cede more and more land until they were pressed into a corner. This last bastion of freedom known as Quentin is the only hope of rallying the troops and striking back against the Dark Wizard.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Demolition Man is a side-scrolling action game (with top-down shooter levels) that is based on the 1993 sci-fi movie of the same name. It was released on SNES, Genesis, Sega CD and 3DO - the two 16-bit console versions and the Sega CD and 3DO versions have some distinct differences based on the multimedia capabilities of the CD format of the latter two versions.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Super criminal Simon Phoenix rules the war torn remnants of Los Angeles and it's time for Officer John Spartan to bring him to justice! Capture Simon and send him to serve his sentence frozen in a block of ice for all eternity. Pursue Simon again when he is unwittingly thawed out in a Utopian future free of crime! Can you catch history's worst criminal a second time with only the help of a lax and unprepared police force? Can you figure out how the three sea shells work!?[CR]Version Differences[CR]Shooting scene from 3DO Version.The Genesis and SNES versions of Demolition Man were wildly different from the Sega CD and 3DO versions.The 16-bit version of the game contained two types of levels: side-scrolling shooter missions and top-down missions in which John Spartan must rescue hostages. The 32-bit versions of the game featured fully digitized character graphics much like the Mortal Kombat games. Sylvester Stallone himself also acted in the game, though clearly in front of a green screen. The levels varied from an on-rails shooter in the vein of Operation Wolf and the NES Punisher game, to hand to hand combat levels with Simon Phoenix that played much like a toned down fighter.Fighting scene from 3DO   [CR]</plot>

There are a few tenants living in the house, like a mobster that just got out of jail, a female wannabe reporter looking for a story, two young female students, a rock band, and a weird handyman that Eddie doesn't seem to like too much. What's their story, and why is Eddie really trapped in the basement?[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is basically the same as in  Night Trap, only this time it has evolved, so you don't need to endlessly switch rooms just to see if something is happening. Instead, on the left side of the screen you have a  heads up display that shows you a map of the house with all the rooms laid out. When someone breaks into a room, an alarm goes off, and the room on your HUD starts flashing. When a person enters a room, an icon appears. A green icon is a tenant, a yellow one is for unknowns, and red icons are bad guys.There are two traps in every room, each with a spring. Choose which trap you want to set off, tighten the spring, and once the person you want to trap steps on a certain mark on the floor, you'll hear a sound indicating that he or she is in place. Spring the trap and watch the bad guy go away. Be careful that you don't trap any of the tenants though, or Eddie will disconnect you.As the story progresses, and you do your job trapping bad guys, you will also need to find a code to get Eddie out of the basement. The code appears in different power boxes around the house, so pay attention when someone opens one up. Also, be extra careful that someone doesn't get their hands on the power box in the basement. If the power goes out, everyone is cut off, and it's  game over.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Dracula Unleashed is an FMV game developed by ICOM Simulations and Viacom New Media. It was published on the Sega CD by Sega and the PC by Viacom New Media in 1993. The story takes place a few years after the events of Bram Stoker's Dracula and all of the main characters from the novel are represented here. The player assumes the role of Alexander Morris, a wealthy Texan, who travels to Victorian England to investigate the death of his brother Quincey.  As Morris you navigate the city seeking out any and all who may have information about the death of your brother. Each "location" is merely a different film sequence which will offer the player clues and infomation. Unlike the  Sherlock Holmes  games, you must stay aware of time and your inventory. Entering houses with different items in your hand, or at different times of the day will trigger different sequences, and certain pivotal scenes can be missed entirely if you mismanage time.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Dragon's Lair</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dirk the Daring's fluid animation and unparalleled visual detail helped make Dragon's Lair a hit.Dragon's Lair was first released as a Laserdisc arcade game in 1983 by Cinematronics, featuring artwork created by former Disney animator Don Bluth. Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as Space Ace, Bega's Battle, and Cliff Hanger.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne. Daphne has been kidnapped by Singe the Dragon, and is now being held in the castle. Dirk's adventure will have him battling monsters and the castle alike as he attempts to save the day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.The gameplay of Dragon's Lair varies wildly from version to version, a common misconception is that the "Quick Time Event" game is the only version of Dragon's Lair in existence, however on platforms like the NES and SNES, Dragon's Lair is a 2D platformer requiring players to navigate multi-tiered stages, finding one of multiple exits to complete a level and progress through the castle to the final boss fight. The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different "chapters" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the Quick Time Event, featured in games like Shenmue, Resident Evil 4, and Heavy Rain.In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played "in reverse" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last "life" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.[CR]Development[CR]Dragon&#8217;s Lair was the brain child of Rick Dyer, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic &#8220;Adventure&#8221; was another inspiration for Dragon&#8217;s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn&#8217;t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic&#8217;s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade Port[CR]On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to Xbox Live Arcade. The port is developed by Digital Leisure and published by Microsoft Studios. The Xbox Live Arcade port includes support for the standard controller, as well as Kinect.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Goddess of Ambition is locked up in the mazes beneath the Darkling tower. A legend is told that once rescued she will grant any wish. A group of heroes stranded in a strange world must attempt to free this divine creature and use her powers to return home.[CR]Dungeon Explorer is a Gauntlet clone. Like that classic game, it is a hybrid between an arcade shooter and a traditional RPG. It supports up to 4 players with a choice of 6 different characters/classes: monk, knight, elf, mage, beast and ninja. On the right side of the screen there is a bar with portraits of the characters: pressing the A button brings up the status menu that displays the current level, experience points, statistics, and equipment. The C button fires the equipped weapon, and the B button uses the character's special ability.[CR]The game starts in the area surrounding a save point. This area functions as a central hub to access all the 6 dungeons. If a character leaves it, the food counter starts decreasing. If it reaches zero, the life points start diminishing until the character dies. Food can be found as potions or pots around the mazes. Returning the character to the save point area replenishes all the counters and cures all conditions (like poisoning and confusion). To the north there are two buildings, a weapon shop and a tavern. The gold collected on the game is spent on equipment upgrades at the weapons shop. The tavern (called Jojo's Bar) allows the player to switch characters. [CR]The characters level up automatically as they amass the necessary experience points. Once a dungeon boss is defeated, the dungeon is locked and the player can't return to it. The game has four save slots, each one for an individual game.</plot>

The game fuses real-time battles with puzzle solving and travelling, although the game now auto-maps. Rain and magic usage effects are incorporated into the engine.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]ESPN Baseball Tonight is a baseball game from Park Place Productions (Stormfront Studios developed the PC port) and published by Sony Imagesoft (now 989 Studios). It features the ESPN (the TV network) license and the MLB license, but not the MLBPA license.Like a few baseball games out at this time, the game features a lower perspective of the field while pitching/batting, almost level with the batter's POV. The screen doesn't transition to an overhead view while fielding, unlike many other baseball games. Along with the traditional tournament and exhibition modes, the player can try their hand at a Home Run Derby and receives a score based on how many homers they hit.ESPN Baseball Tonight was originally released on the Sega CD in 1993. It received additional versions for the core Sega Genesis system, the Super Nintendo and PC MS-DOS, all in 1994. It would be followed by other ESPN-branded sports games, the next being ESPN Sunday Night NFL in August 1994. [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Ecco - The Tides Of Time</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ecco: The Tides of Time is a direct follow-up to the 1993 game, Ecco the Dolphin and developed by Novotrade International (now Appaloosa Interactive). The controls of the first game are identical to the second one, as with the difficulty. It includes all new puzzles such as a Scavenger hunt. There are also new powers, one of them includes Ecco changing into different animals such as a jellyfish, a seagull, a shark and a school of fish. With these new additions, many things from the original game came back. The health and air meter are back along with the Glyphs.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story starts off where the last leaves off: The Vortex Queen is back and follows Ecco back to earth to begin a new hive. Ecco lost his powers from the Ast erite and after he encountered a dolphin with long fins named, Trellia, who was his descendant. She took Ecco to her present which was his future.In Ecco&#8217;s future, Dolphins evolved with telekinetic powers and the power to fly with helium sacks that were on them. The ocean had a mind of its own with &#8216;skyways&#8217; or waterways that floated trough the skies, which connected other parts of water on the earth. Ecco, who was exploring the future, then found the Asterite.When talking to the Asterite, it told Ecco that something was wrong. When Ecco used the time machine the world split into two. One which was a joyful future with flying dolphins, the other was a lifeless wasteland which was dried up by the vortex. Even though the Asterite was killed by the Vortex Queen not until later it was explained how it was talking to Ecco. It then sent him back to the present.Ecco pieced the Asterite together by bringing the globes that made up the creature. The last of the globes had been taken by the Vortex to the future; Ecco had to retrieve them before both he and Asterite could defeat the vortex. They both went to the vortex future that was full of bizarre machines and was much like the last levels of Ecco the Dolphin. Eventually Ecco found the Astrite&#8217;s last two globes and went back to the present.The Asterite was complete again and Ecco got all of his powers back again.Ecco then fought the Vortex Queen using the song to destroy her. Though she escaped to the Atlantean time machine, the Asterite told Ecco to destroy it; instead he uses it to and disappears in to the Tides of Time.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Ecco The Dolphin</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ecco the Dolphin (also known as Ecco) is an aquatic side-scrolling action-adventure game developed by Novotrade and published by Sega for the Genesis in Europe (on July 31, 1992), North America (on December 29, 1992), and Japan (on July 30, 1993).Players control a bottlenose dolphin named Ecco (unique to other dolphins for the six star markings on his forehead) as he embarks on a journey through the oceans, trying to figure out the whereabouts of his group (who were sucked up in a mysterious waterspout) while helping fellow dolphins along the way.Along with its unconventional gameplay mechanics (including a dedicated "sing" button for interaction and echolocation), the game is known for its extreme level of difficulty (which would be a staple for the main games of the series) and bizarre plot development (including time travel and alien abductions). It would later spawn a sequel (Ecco: The Tides of Time), a kid-friendly spin-off (Ecco Jr.), and a 3D reboot (Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future).Along with downscaled ports to the Sega Master System and Game Gear, the game was ported to the Sega CD less than a year later. This version (known in Japan as Ecco the Dolphin CD) features a bonus set of levels and new soundtrack (using Redbook audio), and was later ported to the PC in Japan and North America (both in 1996, featuring new high-resolution sprites).

				<plot>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.[CR]Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</plot>

				<title_clean>Flashback - The Quest For Identity</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Flashback: The Quest for Identity is a 2D action-adventure platform game originally developed by Delphine Software International and published by U.S. Gold for Commodore Amiga home computers in 1992. The game stars plucky protagonist Conrad B. Hart, a young man stricken with total amnesia who finds himself stranded deep in the jungles of an alien world. Similar to Delphine's earlier title Out of This World, Flashback is notable for its use of rotoscoped animation, allowing for a visually fluid representation of the characters' various movements.The game was first released on floppy diskette for the Amiga, a home computer popular in Delphine's native France; it was eventually ported to MS-DOS, Super NES, Genesis, Atari Jaguar and the Acorn Archimedes the following year. A CD-ROM version was later released for MS-DOS, Sega CD, CD-i, 3DO and FM Towns in 1994. Many of Flashback's ports were developed wholly or in part by Tiertex Design Studios.Flashback: The Quest for Identity was followed by its 1995 sequel Fade to Black. The original game was remade in 2013 with full 3D graphics and was released simply as Flashback with no subtitle.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game opens in medias res as protagonist Conrad B. Hart flees down a corridor from a pair of men armed with laser weapons. Conrad jumps onto a hoverbike and temporarily evades his assailants; however, a much larger transport soon gives chase and quickly blasts Conrad's vehicle out of the sky. After a brief search of the crash area, the armed transport flies off, leaving Conrad for dead in the depths of an unknown jungle.AmnesiaFlashback features rotoscoped cutscenes.Conrad awakens the next day in an alien jungle on a planet known as Titan. It becomes apparent he has no memory of events prior to the chase. Upon awakening he notices that he knocked a cube-shaped object off a ledge and sets out to retrieve it. The cube contains a message recorded by the protagonist before he lost his memory. He gives no clues as to what has happened but tells him to seek out his friend Ian who is located in New Washington. Conrad then proceeds to take on the dangers of this jungle to find Ian. After battling enemies in the form of robots and mutants with other obstacles such as turrets and strange fires Conrad eventually comes across a hole in the ground that acts as an entrance to New Washington. An old man who sits near this hole trades an Anti-G Belt that negates the effects of gravity to some extent, for some credits allowing Conrad access to his next location.A short while after arriving in New Washington Conrad discovers Ian being held by a couple of New Washington Police Officers. After battling these men off Ian places Conrad in a machine that recovers his memories. It is revealed that Conrad had discovered a race of aliens was blending in with the human population on Earth in large quantity implying an eventual take over of the planet. His revelation had caught the attention of this alien race who would try to assassinate him. After they failed the first time it prompted Conrad to record the Holo-Cube message found earlier in the game and to send a copy of his memories to Ian. The game's manual would also explain that the alien race is called Morphs and killed Conrad's girlfriend. One night the aliens finally captured Conrad and took him aboard their ship. On this night they erased his memory but failed to secure him as Conrad would awaken and flee his captures, leading to what was witnessed at the beginning of the game.EmploymentWith his memories restored Conrad decides he needs to return to Earth. With little money however, this was never going to be as easy as it sounds. Ian suggests that Conrad should take part in a TV Show where he must fight Cyborgs for a chance to win a ticket to Earth. As it would be too dangerous to compete under his own name Conrad has to get false ID papers. Ian sends him to a contact named Jack, who demands 1,500 credits for the papers. Since he doesn't have that sort of cash on hand Conrad partakes in multiple odd jobs available in New Washington.First he is hired by Titan Spaces Lines for an apparently easy job of collecting and delivering a parcel. Just outsides the parcels destination he is attacked by a member of the NWPD but overcomes him and delivers the package.The second mission comes from Virtual Crop that requests Conrad escort a VIP to their research center. It is made clear that the mission will require a firearm ad the area traveled in will be dangerous. The warning is well advised since mutants infest the area in addition to malfunctioning Security Spheres. Like previously though Conrad succeeds.Titan TV hires Conrad for the third mission. They report that a Model Cy-Borg 2.1 has escaped with the possible assistance of an outsider. It carries a virus which could spread to all other functioning cyborgs. A police officer informs Conrad that the Cy-Borg wants to make a deal. This turns out to be a trap however and Conrad kills the Police Officer for access to 2.1&#8217;s lair. Once in his hideout Conrad eliminates 2.1.The penultimate New Washington mission is accomplished for Titan Senior Advisory Board. Sabotage to the generator that supplies power to New Washington means the city is on the verge of blowing up. Conrad has 90 seconds to locate the sabotaged area and repair it. With only seconds left Conrad repairs the generator and saves New Washington.With only one mission required to gain the necessary credits for the false papers, another party hires Conrad to eliminate the mutant threat that is lurking in all the Restricted Areas. After accomplishing this task Conrad meets Jack one more time who now hands over the papers allowing entry into the game show.The game show of requires participants to fight their way through eight different levels of deadly situations. Littered throughout every level are Cy-Borg 2.1s, Sentry Spheres and mines. Conrad manages to fight through all levels and win a ticket to Earth.Back on EarthEarthConrad believes The Morphs have a hidden base within a night club on Earth but upon arrival is attacked by the local law enforcement and security measures. After some time he locates the nightclub. He breaks in through an upper level thus causing more security measures to become active making his job of finding the Morphs more complicated.After much tribulation Conrad finds himself in a vent shaft above a group of Morphs that are discussing their plans. They reveal that soon their invasion will begin since millions of their kind are ready to teleport in and destroy humanity. Conrad&#8217;s vent then proceeds to collapse under his weight and he is discovered. It is decided that he will be thrown into the dungeon with plans for interrogation.After he wakes up in his cell Conrad discovers he is unarmed and that Cy-Borgs have been sent to his cell to carry out the interrogation. Unexpectedly though Conrad makes a quick burst for the door and evades the Cy-Borgs. Luckily enough his gun was not too far away and he is able to destroy his would-be interrogators. Further into their lair Conrad finally confronts the Morphs in combat. With their ability to take and lose shape whenever they want Conrad has a difficult time but overcomes everyone he meets. With the realization that the Morph invasion is close with no time to report it, Conrad teleports to the Morph home planet with the intention of stopping their conquest.On the planet Conrad tries to assist a human prisoner who is in possession of explosives. Unfortunately the man is killed by a Morph upon his release but lives long enough to give Conrad the destructive device. Conrad discovers a diary on the planet that reveals a captive human scientist managed to enter the theory of molecular research into a Titan computer. This theory was taken up by Conrad who made glasses revealing the aliens living among the human population. It is also revealed that The Master Brain, positions at the center of the planet, controls all morphs, destroying him will end the race. The device Conrad holds was created by the scientist and is powerful enough to destroy the entire planet.With other options being non-existent, Conrad decides to put the scientist's plan into action. He travels all the way into the planet&#8217;s core. After battling more Morphs the Master Brain is killed. After dropping the Atomic Charge into the foundations of the planet Conrad races against time to escape the planet in a docked ship before the planet explodes.Conrad only just makes it, with the ship just out of reach from the destructive force of the Atomic Device. Conrad soon learns though that he is in a galaxy unrecognized by the ship&#8217;s systems. With the possibility of being lost in space forever Conrad places himself in cryogenic suspension to be awakened if he is ever discovered.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Genesis version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 9,9,9,8 in addition to the Editor's Choice Gold award. They added, "...one of the best games ever made for the Genesis. The action is non-stop, and it really feels like you're playing a movie!...get a joystick, because the generic Sega controllers aren't precise enough to handle the diagonal motions necessary for some of the specialized techniques".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Misadventures of Flink is a Jump'n Run set in the fantasy world of Imagica. The evil wizard Wicked Wainwright has captured the four elders and it is up to Flink, a wizard's apprentice, to set them free and defeat Wicked Wainwright.[CR]Apart from the usual platformer elements, the game has a unique feature: Flink's ability to create spells. Whenever the game is paused, Flink can combine three ingredients to create a spell. Ingredients can be collected throughout the game. They are usually carried around by a certain type of enemy or hidden in treasure chests. There are ten different spells, the "recipes" which are contained in scrolls that are given to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain levels. The spells include different attack spells (for example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic keys that open locked treasure chests and more. [CR]Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic bottles or defeating enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, when Flink is hit, he looses all of his magic energy and has only limited time to pick it up again. If he is hit while having no magic energy, he loses a life.</plot>

				<title_clean>Formula One World Championship - Beyond The Limit</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Formula One World Championship: Beyond the Limit is a F1 racing game that was developed by Fuji Television Network and published by Sega sometime in 1994. The game follows the 1993 F1 season, with every race accounted for and the majority of the drivers playable. The game was released in Japan as Heavenly Symphony: Formula One World Championship 1993.[CR]The Game[CR]There are three modes in the game; Grand Prix, 1993 Mode and Free Run.In Grand Prix mode you follow a story line and meet with all the actual people who own, design and race the cars. Your first race here is a qualification race to see which teams want to recruit you. After you select which team you wish to race for you meet with the people who make that team work, learn a bit about the company and then head out to race with story bits cut in after each race to clue you in on the behind the scenes rivalries and drama.In 1993 Mode you follow along the 1993 Formula Season and the game then acts as a semi-documentary interlacing levels with FMV, giving the stats on each race and any unique events that happened during the race. You control a set character and then accomplish tasks that happened during the actual race. For the South African Grand Prix you play as JJ Lehto trying to catch up to Derek Warwick in the middle of a thunderstorm.Free Race mode is exactly as it sounds. You decide which track to race, how many laps and the weather conditions.[CR][B]Teams:[/B][CR]Williams FW 15C#0 Damon Hill#2 Alain ProstTyrrell 020C#3 Ukyo Katayama#4 Andrea de CesarisBenetton B193B#5 Michael Schumacher#6 Riccardo PatreseMcLaren MP4/8#7 Michael Andretti#_ Your CharacterFootwork FA14#9 Derek Warwick#10 Aguri SuzukiLotus 107B#11 Alex Zanardi#12 Johnny HerbertJordan 193#14 Rubens Barrichello#15 Ivan CapelliLarrousse LH93#19 Phillippe Alliot#20 Erik ComasLola-BMS- T93/30#21 Michele Alboreto#22 Luca BadoerMinardi M193#23 Christian Fittipaldi#24 Fabrizio BarbazzaLigier JS39#25 Martin Brundle#26 Mark BlundellFerrari F93A#27 Jean Alesi#28 Gerhard BergerSauber C12#29 Karl Wendlinger#30 JJ Lehto[CR]One Missing Driver[CR]It's worth noting that the missing driver in the roster (the second McLaren car) was Ayrton Senna. Ironic considering Sega's previous F1 game was Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II, not to mention this game was released in the same year that Senna died at Imola.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Heart of the Alien is the sequel to the game Out of this World, also known as Another World.  The story picks up immediately after the end of the first game.  You begin as Lester and his alien friend, "Buddy," land their pterodactyl in the ruins of Buddy's village. Lester was knocked unconscious in their escape, so Buddy lays him down on a cot to rest. The people who used to live in Buddy's village remain enslaved, so he decides to go on a mission to free them.  Thus, you control Buddy as he sets off to free the people and find a way to send Lester home.[CR]Buddy controls somewhat similarly to how Lester did in the first game. He has some new moves that are provided by his powerful energized whip.  Buddy can swing from ceiling in some instances, for example.[CR]As a bonus, this Sega CD disc includes the original Out of this World, so that you can seamlessly play both adventures as if they were one long game.</plot>

				<plot>You play as Heimdall, a demi-god based in Norse mythology. Heimdall's job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. [CR]Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these worlds to collect the god's weapons.[CR]The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants) and the third is Asgard itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.[CR]When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.[CR]The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard).[CR]Once you've done this it's time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god's missing weapons.</plot>

				<plot>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.[CR]This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</plot>

				<plot>A rogue navy ship, Jeremiah Obrian, threatens to start a war. A virus has wiped out its crew, but the threat of it firing its Iron Helix doomsday weapon is still there. You must remotely pilot an unarmed science robot to explore the ship and work out how to shut the weapon down.[CR]The game uses interactive quarter-screen footage to display the ship's interiors. The main challenge is that an automated security device is chasing you down, and must be avoided and ultimately destroyed. A delay between your commands and the robot's receipt of them forces you to pay close attention to the security drone and plan several steps ahead.[CR]As you explore the ship, you will find data ports, which can be jacked into to gain information or to open doorways. To access most of these, you will need to find and collect a DNA sample from a member of staff whose role gave him/her access.</plot>

				<plot>In the early nineties, the Jaguar XJ220 was the fastest serial-produced car ever. Core Design acquired the right to build a game around it, in a move to counter Gremlin's immensely successful Lotus series.[CR]Just like Lotus, Jaguar XJ200 is a view from behind racer. There are 32 tracks all over the world, with varying road conditions and animated weather conditions such as rain and fog in England, snow in Switzerland, and tumbleweed crossing the street in Egypt. You race your Jaguar in a constructor grand prix, with opponents running for Porsche, Ferrari and other famous makers. Between races, you must mend the damage your car has sustained, which eats up your prize money. Background music is selected through a dashboard CD player, which also features some rather uninspiring radio stations.[CR]The game can also be played in a two-player split-screen mode and features a track editor for when you tire of the built-in courses.</plot>

				<plot>This is the Sega CD game based on the 1993 Steven Spielberg movie based on the book by Michael Crichton. This game differs greatly from other Jurassic Park games. It is a point-and-click adventure game, with a strong emphasis on action sequences which require split-second timing.[CR]The story takes place after the events of the movie/book. You are sent back to Jurassic Park to retrieve dinosaur eggs from around the park and put them in an incubator. You only have 12 hours to retrieve one egg from every species of dino in the park. Unfortunately, shortly before arriving at the park, your helicopter crashes!</plot>

				<plot>Remember the days as a kid when you were fascinated with these big machines on the building site? With this game you have the opportunity to try them out! You can use either the excavator, bulldozer, steamroller or wrecking ball. The handling couldn't be easier, there are just three buttons to press: left, right and use.[CR]With each machine you get a simple task, e.g. carry three shovels of dirt on a truck. But the fun thing is that you aren't restricted to this and can just screw around. Why wreck an old house when the pit latrine is so much more tempting? The whole game is presented in full motion video - the reactions are very humorous and with a fair share of slapstick. To improve the long time motivation there are even multiple videos for every action, e.g. the first time you break a road block with the the excavator you drive on a highway, the second time into a canyon, the third time onto a rollercoaster and so on...</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lethal Enforcers was first released into American arcades by Konami on Oct. 14, 1992. Considered to be the first in the police simulator sub-genre of light-gun shooters, it, along with Mad Dog McCree and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, became wildly popular in arcades and ushered in a Golden Age for light-gun shooters. The success of Lethal Enforcers led to the development of franchises such as Virtua Cop and Time Crisis, both of which borrow heavily from the game's core design and concepts.The player takes the role of a police officer from Chicago named Don Marshall, who battles a major crime syndicate that has invaded the city (with a "partner" if played with 2 players) through 5 levels. The stages, in order, are "The Bank Robbery", "Chinatown Assault", "The Hijackers", "Drug Dealers", and "Chemical Plant". In each stage, Don has to shoot criminals that pop out of the scenery before they shot him. Occasionally an innocent civilian appears instead, and by shooting them Don loses health and penalizes the player's final score. Don can collect additional weapons throughout the level that are more powerful than his standard gun, such as a magnum or shotgun, but they are lost if hit.In the Arcades, players used a plastic revolver-like light-gun to play the game, called the "Konami Justifier". The gun was colored blue for Player 1 and pink for Player 2. The standard gun in the game has 6 shots, and to reload the gun players has to fire the trigger off-screen. On home versions of the game, players can use a gun that is bundled with the game, or a standard controller.[CR]</plot>

Good use of VGA's 256 colors made for a realistic course with trees, water, sandtraps, and the fairway.  The addition of ball physics, mulligans, changing the lie of the ball, real digitized environmental sounds (even through the PC speaker), and the ability to view a replay (even from multiple angles) gave PC golf games a new echelon of quality to match.

You will move your visor with the joystick and shoot at the targets with the fire button.Your first mission will consist in delivering the cargo within 9 minutes which is not easy at all. If you choose the wrong track along the way, you are on for another turn before you get back to the junction and make the good choice. Fortunately, Mortimer will indicate you the right direction but sometimes you are so busy trying to blow up things around you that you don't even have time to steer the ship.  Another thing to watch out is the incoming traffic. If you react too slowly to Mortimer's warnings, you will end up in a collision with the traffic, causing an explosion and your untimely death along with the loss of one life. Another kind of traffic hazard is the slow traffic. The only way not to bump into is to buzz your horn and make them speed up their engines. It will prevent you from further damages.  The damages can be repaired in zones that Mortimer will indicate to you, but the best way to stay alive is to use your shields when you are attacked. Finally, at the end of each episode, you will have to destroy a boss that is chasing you around.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title screen. Lords of Thunder (called Winds of Thunder in Japan) is a side scrolling shooter developed by RED and published by Hudson for the Turbo CD and Sega CD. Beyond its gameplay, the game is probably best known for its heavy metal soundtrack.  [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Landy versus Zaggart. Lords of Thunder's plot follows the attempted resurrection of an evil god named Deoric (Zaggart in the PC Engine version) by a force of six evil generals who serve the Dark Priest Zonbul of the Gald Kingdom. The player controls a brave knight by the name of Landy (a.k.a. Duran) who is granted a variety of magical armor by the goddess Farina. The generals have conquered the six kingdoms of Mistral to channel energy to the tower of Gald in order to revive Zaggart; Landy has to stop them all before it's too late![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The shop. Lords of Thunder's horizontal-scrolling shooting is augmented by a choice of four elemental armors and a shop that sells useful items before he enters the fray. Landy can also strike with his sword by moving close to the enemy and holding down the attack button; he continues to shoot as normal as well, and the sword strikes are quite powerful! Each armor also has a different effect when a "bomb" is used.Wind Armor: The wind armor fires moderately powerful shots straight forward; its power is simply increased as the weapon energy gauge is filled. The least useful armor. When a bomb is used in the wind armor, waves of lightning are emitted in both directions from Landy.Water Armor: Shoots waves of blue energy in addition to the basic shot. As this weapon is leveled up the energy waves become larger and more powerful; at max level waves are also fired backwards. The waves are strong and penetrate certain types of walls, making this a very easy to use armor. Perhaps tellingly, Landy is depicted as wearing this on the game's cover and in the game's cutscenes... When a bomb is used in the water armor, the screen is covered with spinning whirlpool like objects.Fire Armor: A basic armor with flame-based attacks. At max level the explosive fire shots evolve in to a powerful flame-thrower which is moderately controllable based on the player's movement. When a bomb is used in the fire armor a fiery salamander is summoned to destroy enemies.Earth Armor: The earth armor fires an extremely powerful "bomb" type-projectile towards the ground at an arc in front of Landy. When leveled half-way it also shoots one towards the ceiling; at max level they emit large shockwaves and are easily the most powerful attacks in the game. Get in close on bosses' weak points to kill them extremely fast! When a bomb is used in the earth armor meteors rain from the heavens.ItemsMost of these items can only be purchased at the store; however, crystals and a couple of other items are dropped by enemies, too!  A "fairystone" bomb.Crystals: The basic currency to be used at the shop, these are dropped by all sorts of enemies. Blue crystals are worth five and red are worth twenty-five.Lifestone: The variety dropped in stages, this restores three points of life to Landy. Quite rare!Magic stone: The variety dropped in stages, these increase Landy's weapon power. Blue ones add one point of weapon power and red ones add five.Lifestone (lv1): Only available at the shop, this adds two points of life to Landy's life meter.Lifestone (lv2): Only available at the shop, this adds five points of life to Landy's life meter.Lifestone (max): Only available at the shop, this completely fills Landy's life meter!Magic stone (lv1): Only available at the shop, this adds 3 to Landy's weapon meter.Magic stone (lv2): Only available at the shop, this adds 8 to Landy's weapon meter.Magic shield (lv1): A barrier that allows Landy to take a hit without taking damage.Magic shield (lv2): A slightly superior magic shield, this allows Landy to take two free hits.Magic shield (lv3): The best of the magic shields, this allows Landy to take three hits.Fairy stone: These are the "bombs" of the game, and their effect depends on the armor being worn when they are used. Up to three can be stored at one time.Elixir: This expensive item will completely restore Landy's life meter once when it has been fully depleted.Continue: Allows the player to continue if they get a game over![CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]The game's first six stages can be completed in any order.AuzalAuzal - the water stage: A watery area full of water dragons, jellyfish and winged soldiers. A strange monster is encountered as a mid-boss; a large portion of the stage takes place under water. Auzal is controlled by general Aspidd, who transforms in to a large half-snake beast headed demon for her duel with Landy.Dezant - the desert stage: This stage is filled with the basic magic flying soldiers who will trouble Landy throughout the game; half-way through the stage Landy descends in to a cave only to have to escape it in a high-speed sequence while avoiding the collapsing roof and enemies riding platforms covered with rotating blades. General Scorpion controls this area, transforming in to a large insectoid monster to fight Landy. Helado - the ice stage: With strong enemies and tricky obstacles this stage isn't to be taken lightly! Avoid getting blown around by the ice-faces in the cave and don't get crushed by falling icicles! This area is controlled by general Matansha, who transforms in to a kirin like beast.Cielom Cielom - the sky stage: Landy flies high in to the sky while battling rotating flame-spewing skulls and suicidal spearmen who leap from flying turtles and the windows of a huge flying cathedral. The cathedral proper is also defended by large iron golems. The boss is general Pajarona, second in command only to the dark priest Zonbul himself.Bosque - the forest stage: A creepy forest full of strange and dangerous wildlife, including man-eating plants, pulsing pods, and titanic insects. General Jardein is in command here; he transforms in to a massive creature which can fire a powerful stream of energy from its weak point.LlamaradaLlamarada - the volcano stage: The player must guide Landy up the outside of a volcano while avoiding fragments from an eruption and then down inside of the volcano to a fortress inside of it! Unsurprisingly this area is full of fiery enemies, including phoenixes and multi-headed firebreathing beasts. The intimidatingly named General Ballrender has mastery over the denizens here; he transforms in to a large demonic warrior with the power to seperate in to spheres. Zonbul's battle form. The seventh stage, the Dark Tower of Gald, is automatically entered after completing the first six stages. The first part is a typical stage where Landy advances up the tower to fight Zonbul at the end; the second segment involves Landy being granted infinite weapon energy by the Goddess Farina for the final duel with Zaggart.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Game disc.Like many disc-based games of the early 90s, Lords of Thunder takes advantage of the CD format with heavy metal instrumental music that goes far beyond hardware limitations of the era. The soundtrack was produced by Japanese music house T's Music.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Lunar - Eternal Blue</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A classically styled Japanese RPG, the game centers around a small band of heroes traveling the world of Lunar via a World Map. Scattered throughout that overworld map are towns, cities, and outposts where the player can interact with NPCs, buy new equipment and items, and heal themselves at Goddess Shrines. These areas act as respites where the player can progress the story in a narrative fashion. Dungeons, shrines, temples, and many other dungeon-like areas are also scattered throughout the overworld map of Lunar. In these areas, the player can progress the story through fighting enemies and bosses. The player will also fight in Lunar's overworld map while traveling from one place to another. The game is largely linear but the player can backtrack and even, after a certain point, travel around the world of Lunar if they so choose.The fighting system is menu driven and turn-based. Each turn, the player can either issue commands to each character in their party or allow the computer, through a pre-fight A.I. option, to fight for them. The player can have up to five characters in their party at any one time. The only character the player can't control is Lucia. Lucia will change her fighting techniques as the story progresses. Her health is dictated by Hiro's health. Each character can fight by performing a normal attack, using magic, defending themselves, using an item, running away, or the player can let the computer decide what that specific character will do for that turn with the A.I. option. The character's location relative to the enemy will determine if, and how well, they will be able to attack that enemy. Melee characters require close proximity to the enemy while magic users and ranged characters can fight at a distance. The characters' locations can be determined by the player in the options screen before or after a battle. The player can also set up multiple tactics in the game's option menu that can be selected at the start of each battle. If all of the characters in the player's party die the game ends.Each character is defined by a number of stats that determine how they perform in battle. These stats will improve as the player fights more enemies and gains more and more experience points. After a certain amount of experience points are earned, the characters will level up. Each level comes with increased stats and, occasionally, new abilities. Each character has a certain number of hit-points and magic-points. The character passes out (or dies) once their hit-points reach zero. Each magical ability uses a specific allotment of magic-points. When a character's magic-points reach zero that character can no longer use magic. As the characters level up their hit-points and magic-points increase. After each battle, Hiro's companion Ruby is given magic experience points (MEP). MEP is used to save the player's game (which can be done anywhere as long as the player has enough MEP). MEP can also be used to increase the levels of each magical ability each character has. As a magical ability increases so does its usefulness.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]HiroRubyLuciaGwynLeminaJeanRonfarAlthenaNallGhaleonWhite Knight LeoBlue Master LunnBlack Wizard MorganRed Priest MauriZophar[CR]Playstation Remake[CR]This game was remade in 2001 for the PlayStation.

				<title_clean>Lunar - The Silver Star</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lunar is a role-playing game developed by Game Arts and Studio Alex for the Sega CD. The game centers around the main protagonist, Alex, a young boy from a small town who dreams to one day become a hero like his idol, Dragonmaster Dyne. The game begins with Alex and his friends going on a child hood adventure and stumbling upon an ancient dragon. They then begin a journey across the world to gather the necessary power to become the next Dragonmaster, and save the world.Game Arts set out to create a story that would break away from the, "hum-drum 'model" games that "had stories, but had no story-telling" when they created Lunar. They chose the Sega CD as their platform for it's video playback capabilities and hired on animator and artist Toshiyuki Kubooka to oversee the planning of the video sequences and voice overs. Novelist Kei Shigema was then hired on to pen the script and plot to the game. The team decided to focus on on a fantasy world heavy in mythos and history that would gradually reveal itself to players over time. Studio Alex handled most of the developing of the title.[CR]American Development[CR]The American development and translation was handled by Working Designs. They completed the text translation in an 8 week marathon programming session. During the translation they added in their own humor, mostly in the form of pop culture references from the early 90s such as allusions to American commercials, celebrities, colloquialisms, products, and role-playing game cliches. Working Designs president  Victor Ireland took the project very seriously. He often collaborated with the original Japanese development team. He also added in a couple of new sequences he felt enhanced the game and story, including the scene where we see Alex play the harp to awaken Luna.Ireland's biggest contribution which many fans would thank him for is Lunar's packaging. He made sure extra effort was put into the game's packaging, giving the instruction booklet embossed lettering, and having seven separate disc stamps, each with different artwork, produced for the front of the game discs -- all in the effort to increase collection value. Below are stamps 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 (missing are 3 and 5). Stamp 1 is the most common and they get more rare as they go with stamp 7 being the most difficult to obtain. As you can see disc 1 and 2 look nearly identical. Disc 1 was manufactured by SEGA and they were not familiar with the "groove fill" process. For this reason Working Designs made disc 2 the same art, but filled it all the way. Working Designs also manufactured, under their direct control, discs 2-7 for quality assurance reasons.[CR]Reception [CR]The game was released in Japan on June 26, 1992 to critical acclaim, and became the number 1 selling game on the Sega CD of all time in Japan selling an estimated 100,000 copies, or nearly as many Sega CD consoles sold in Japan. The game launched on December 1, 1993 in America, also to much acclaim. It would go on to be the second best selling game world wide for the Sega CD, behind only Sonic the Hedgehog CD.[CR]Remakes[CR]The game was been re-made on three separate occasions.  Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete was released on the  Sega Saturn in Japan on October 15, 1996 and included redrawn graphics, a polished script, and new music by  Noriyuki Iwadare. This version was then expanded upon in July 1997 with the addition of an MPEG expansion card for the  Saturn. The updated MPEG version was then ported to the  Playstation in 1998, and Working Designs then handled another English translation and brought the  Playstation version stateside in May 1999. A  Windows PC version was also released in 1999, exclusively in Korea and Japan -- the North American version was canceled for technical difficulties.  Lunar Legend is a retelling of the events of Lunar Silver Star on the  Game Boy Advance. Developed by  Japan Art Media and published in America by  Ubisoft,  Lunar Legend deviates more than any of the other re-makes. The dialogue and situations that characters face are noticeably different. The FMV sequences were replace with still screens to tell the story. The game was released in March 2002 in Japan and the following year in America. The American release did not feature any of the pop culture and quirky humor that  Working Designs was known for, as they were not involved with this version.  Lunar: Silver Star Harmony was released on March 2nd 2010 in North America for the  Playstation Portable both digitally on  PSN and on UMD via retailers. This remake includes a new isometric view, new hand-drawn style graphics for the characters and backgrounds, complete voice over throughout for the lead character ( Alex), new cut-scenes to help clear up gaps in the story, and a remixed soundtrack.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]MegaRace is an MS-DOS PC title by Cryo Interactive released in the early 90s. The player is thrust into the role of a contestant on a game show in which the goal is to battle gangs in an armored, weapon equipped vehicle in dysotopian enivronments.Darkly humorous FMV scenes featuring the show's host, Lance Boyle, helped create the atmosphere of a slightly inhumane, high-stakes game show, but the actual gameplay was not much more than a futuristic Chase H.Q. clone, albeit a futuristic Chase H.Q. clone with pretty pre-rendered graphics. Many Packard Bell multi-media computers of the time came with the game pre-installed to show off the power of the CD-ROM medium, which had just come into vogue with the release of Myst in 1993.The game was ported to the 3DO and Sega CD a few months after its release on PC.A MegaRace Reboot is in the works by the Bernie Stolar headed Firm, ZOOM.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Mickey Mania - The Timeless Adventures Of Mickey Mouse</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse (known in Europe as Mickey Mania) is a side-scrolling platformer developed by Traveller's Tales (in conjunction with Psygnosis) and published by Sony Imagesoft for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on October 1994 and for the Genesis and Sega CD on November 1994. The Japanese version was only released for the SNES (by Capcom) and Genesis (by Sega).Originally developed to celebrate the 65th birthday of Disney mascot Mickey Mouse, the game has the titular mouse adventuring through some of his various short films (from the 1928 Steamboat Willie to the 1990 The Prince and the Pauper) as he must find his past selves, rescue his dog Pluto, and defeat Pete.Made in collaboration with Disney, the game is one of the few games to feature digitized animations from Disney-affiliated animation studios (from the Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida division in collaboration with Creative Capers Entertainment).Each subsequent version of the game includes new sequences and minor additions. For example, both the Sega console versions add a new hidden bonus sequence (based on the 1935 short film The Band Concert) and a "spiral staircase" sequence in the second level. The Sega CD version features both redbook audio and digitized voice samples of Mickey, as well as an extra sequence before the final boss.The game was later ported on March 1996 to the PlayStation in Europe (as Mickey's Wild Adventure), featuring enhanced graphics and graphical effects and a new "chase" sequence in the fifth level (where Mickey is pursued by Willie the Giant). This version was later digitally re-released via PlayStation Network on December 13, 2011 (in Europe) for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mickey Mania is fairly typical of the side-scrolling platform genre. Players guide Mickey from left to right through levels, passing obstacles through  jumping or  solving puzzles. Enemies can be defeated either by jumping on them or by  throwing marbles at them. The game is famously difficult: a lot of this difficulty is because some of the game requires a lot of precise timing and many of the enemies are hard to defeat without taking damage.At the top left hand corner of the screen is Mickey's Glove. The number under the glove symbolizes the number of lives the player has remaining and the fingers of the glove show how many hits Mickey can take before losing a life.[CR]Items[CR]In Mickey Mania there are three types of items at Mickey's disposal, each with a different purpose:Stars: These give you 1 health (finger) back per star. If Mickey has full health and gets the stars, they will disappear and he will NOT get an extra life.Marbles: The main tool for getting through most levels in this game. Marbles are everywhere to collect and the serve as a means of hitting enemies and bosses. They are transferable from level to level though Mickey has a holding limit of 99 marbles.Mouse Ears: Mickey's Mouse Ears can come in very handy and are in secretive locations throughout the game. They replenish one full life, regardless if you have not previously lost a life.[CR]Cartoons Featured as Levels[CR]There are a total of 7 levels to play through in Mickey Mania.Steamboat Willie (1928)The level starts Mickey out on the steamboat from the famous 1928 animated short, and after a short time on the boat the level continues on land. Mickey is faced with challenging platforming elements already on the first stage, and he'll also meet  Pete as a  mini boss in this stage. At the end of the level Mickey can actually find two branching paths: one that leads to a crane boss battle, and another, which leads Mickey to a secret area with tons of marbles and  1-ups.In the level Mickey will find small details from the animated short, like the "musical goat" and the iconic boat-horns.The Mad Doctor (1933)This level starts up with a little homage to  Dragon's Lair by basically copying the start of the game. Mickey continues through The Mad Doctor's  castle and is faced with classic enemies like  skeletons and  bats; Mickey are even meets with a  elevator and an on-rail jumping section. At the end Mickey fights The Mad Doctor and saves his dog  Pluto before the poor hound is experimented upon.The Band Concert (1935)This is a secret bonus level in which players must navigate to the top of a  tornado. This is basically one of the tower sections and as such is not featured in the SNES version.Moose Hunters (1937)Players follow Pluto (In the cartoon,  Goofy and  Donald were alongside Mickey, not Pluto) through this level. Enemies including a  moose who charges at Mickey and environmental hazards too such as falling branches and boulders.Lonesome Ghosts (1937)This level features the titular lonesome  ghosts who attempt to halt Mickey's progress with all sorts of tricks and jokes. This level has some tricky sections and a memorable section where water levels rise and fall.Mickey and the Beanstalk (1947)This level forces Mickey to "do some gardening" and has him contend with not just a giant (Additionally, an escape section featuring the giant is in CD versions, though not others) but also a giant spider. This level features the only friendly  NPC in the game apart from various Mickeys and Pluto - a  ladybug who helps Mickey escape the spider.The Prince and the Pauper (1990)The game makes a large jump in time (43 years) to feature The Prince and the Pauper. This level features the most difficult combat in the game, including a boss battle against a very powerful Pete which has two forms.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Released on the Sega/Mega CD, 3DO, Amiga CD32 and the PC (DOS game), in 1993. Developed, produced and distributed by   psygnosis LTD.  There are some slight difference between the versions. With the PC and 3DO versions looking the best.  The game has some quite interesting concepts, being set entirely within the confines of a human body. And also has political as well as environmental overtones.Explore the human body!It is the mid twenteith century ,and two gigantic global corporations are fighting for control of the planet. There aims are complete supremacy and hegemony over all. The earth is an overcrowded, over polluted mess. Cyber-Tech Industries, one of the two dominant company's on the planet, is being challenged by it's only real rival the Axiom corporation, who blame Cyber-tech for their president's (CEO's) death. To gain revenge and therefore total domination they secretly inject Cyber-Tech's president, Mr Anton Korsby, with a deadly genetically altered virus that threatens to take control of his body and ultimately destroy him, and bring down CyberTech with him. Your mission is to enter president Korsby's body and locate the virus at it's source and destroy it, before the organism takes complete control of his central nervous system.AmigaCD 32 screen shotMicrocosm is a 3D action shooter. Your job is to pilot your way through various parts of the anatomy lungs, veins etc, blasting enemy ships while trying to aviod interfering with his vital organs. Your vessel will become faster and stronger as the game progresses by picking up power-ups which will aid you in your mission to save the president as quickly as possible. Eventually you will make your way up to the brain, where you must defeat Grey M, the parasite that is trying to control Korsby's body.Microcosm makes use of the larger  storage abilitiy of the CD format. Using it  to cram in lots of   full-motion video (FMV) and with high-resolution fractal graphics, which are used to great effect to simulate the walls of veins/arteries. Also digital music can be heard throughout the game as well as a good selection of digital sound effects, simulating internal bodily sounds.  The Sega CD version of the game was later sold with  Ultraverse Prime.  [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR]The Mission[CR]"Operation Midnight", a simple reconnaissance mission, looks straight forward enough. As the rookie gunner of the first Apache "Dragonfly", your job is to rescue Victor Mensch, a world renowned expert on nerve gases who is being held hostage at the Al Shakkur chemical installation deep in enemy territory.As the rookie of the Midnight Raiders team, you're psyched to get up there and show them what you're made of. But within seconds, two Blackhawk troop carriers are shot down over enemy targets. Waiting for your next command from OpCom, you suddenly realize something has gone terribly wrong. With only 2 choppers and no air cover, you're chances of making it out alive are getting slimmer by the minute. And yet, CIA agent Adams refuses to abort "Operation Midnight".Now there's no turning back. You've got to penetrate a wall of heavily armed security guards, retrieve the hostage, plant a tactical nuke in a specific locale and get out of the plant before it blows. All Adams asks is that you "extract the professor and leave no traces".As you dive into danger, first in the air, than on foot and finally by jeep, you can't help but wonder - why was this seemingly ill-fated missions ordered to continue? Could it be that you - a rookie shooter - are completely expendable at the hands of one crooked bureaucrat?`Taken straight out of the Sega CD manual`[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR]The Game[CR]The game is the first nine episodes of the TV show. Gameplay revolves around watching the action scenes and pushing the buttons whenever a Power Ranger kicks or punches, and also pressing directions to dodge of throw enemies. Since the footage has only one outcome you are given a life bar and whenever you miss the timing of your button presses it decreases until you have lost and it's game over. However during the morphing sequences, you regain a portion of your health. Correctly pressing the buttons also adds to your score; get a high score and see where you place on the in-game leaderboard.There are three difficulties with each subsequently harder one giving you an extra episode, so if you play on the easy setting you aren't getting to play along with two episodes.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]GET OVER HERE!Mortal Kombat is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway in 1992 for arcades. After initial popularity, it was ported to most fourth-generation consoles (in a special event known as "Mortal Monday").The game was controversial due to the combination of excessive gore and violence (including post-battle execution moves known as Fatalities) and fully-digitized character graphics, two concepts that were introduced to the fighting game genre by Mortal Kombat. Originally designed as a video game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme (whose likeness can be seen in the character Johnny Cage), the game introduced a monstrous franchise that spawned a multitude of sequels, a series of comic books, music CDs, a live tour, two television shows, and two major motion pictures (Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat Annihilation).The game revolves around the brutal Mortal Kombat tournament held in a hidden island ruled by the evil sorceror Shang Tsung (whose half-dragon, half-human bodyguard, Goro, remains the undefeated champion of the tournament). Each of the seven playable characters enter the tournament for different reasons (some for revenge, while others for glory). The main protagonist is Liu Kang, a Shaolin Monk of the White Lotus society who wants to bring honor back to the Mortal Kombat tournament. The main storyline was expanded through comics and sequels, involving the evil forces of Outworld, who use the tournament in order to take over Earth (known as Earthrealm).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade button layout in the classic "X" formation.Mortal Kombat plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. The 5-button layout was laid out in an "X" pattern and featured High Punch and Low Punch on the left, High Kick and Low Kick on the right, and a dedicated Block button (a first for 2D fighting games) in the middle. Depending on the distance and joystick position, players can perform uppercuts, roundhouse kicks, backhand punches, and leg sweeps. The game introduced special moves that do not require circular joystick movement or holding the joystick in a certain direction. Scorpion's trademark Spear Throw for instance is performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then pressing the low punch button. The game also introduced special moves that do not require any button presses, such as Raiden's Flying Torpedo, performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then tapping towards the opponent on the joystick once.This is the only fighting game in the franchise to include a scoring system (using points) for its high score table. Players earn points by damaging other players, winning a round, and winning the Test Your Might mini-game. The amount of points for winning the round is based on time, amount of damage taken (taking no damage in a round results in a Flawless Victory bonus, while taking no damage in the second round results in a Double Flawless bonus of 500,000 points), and whether or not the player performs a Fatality (which earns the player 100,000 points).FatalitiesFATALITY!One key feature of the fighting game genre made possible (and famous) by Mortal Kombat is the Fatality, which serves as a glorified finishing move that can only be performed upon a losing player at the end of the final round. Fatalities are special button and joystick combinations that are time-restricted. Failing to perform one usually results in the opponent falling unceremoniously to the ground, with the only penalty being a loss of the Fatality bonus. Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile do not perform Fatalities, and likewise players can not perform a Fatality on Goro or Shang Tsung. Other than The Pit Stage Fatality, performing a Fatality earns the player 100,000 points. In some home versions, Fatalities are referred to as "Finishing Moves".Simply performing an uppercut (or performing Liu Kang's Fatality) on The Pit will knock the opponent over the side of the bridge, who will then be impaled through the spikes below. This is not available in the Sega Genesis (without the Blood Code activated), Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, or Sega Master System versions.Test Your MightRaiden chopping a pile of wood for bonus points.Every three matches against the CPU opponent or every five matches against human opponents brings the player(s) to a mini-game called "Test Your Might", which requires each player to repeatedly tap certain buttons to build up a yellow bar (which quickly decreases). Once the bar reaches a certain point, the player presses another button to attempt to chop the object placed in front of them. The required point of breakage and points awarded for a successful chop is increased for each level. (100,000 points for Wood, 200,000 points for Stone, 500,000 points for Steel, 750,000 points for Ruby, and 1,000,000 points for Diamond)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character Selection Screen with player one as Kano and player two as Sub-Zero.The game includes seven playable characters and two bosses. After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all seven combatants (including a mirror match), then progress through three "endurance matches" (in which players must defeat two opponents consecutively to win a round), and then battle the two bosses: Goro and Shang Tsung.Introduced in later versions of the arcade (and the home console ports) is the unplayable Reptile, the third ninja palette swap with moves of both Scorpion and Sub-Zero. He randomly appears before matches to provide clues on how to reach him. If the player can decipher these hints, they will know that Reptile can be fought by performing a Fatality on The Pit stage without taking damage or blocking in the final round, and even then he will only show himself if a shadow appears over the moon in the background at some point during the match. Defeating him earns the player 10,000,000 points.[CR]Johnny Cage[CR](not available in the Game Boy version)Actor: Daniel Pesina</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Panic! is a surreal adventure puzzle game for the Sega CD, developed by Sega and published by Data East in the United States in 1994. The game is like a lot of Sega CD games of the era that can only be loosely described as a "game" at all. The plot of the game is that a computer that controls the world has gone corrupt and has caused the world's electronic devices to go haywire. It's up to a boy and his dog to find their way to the central computer and fix it, to do this players must push a variety of switches and hope for the best. Quite literally that's the game, each scene in the game has a panel of switches that you can press with only one advancing you forward, some will take you backwards to the previous scene and some will just make weird things happen (such as whales flying by inside your house). There is a map that allows you to chart your progress, and there is an ending to the game.The game was re-released in Japan for the Playstation 2 in 2002.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Panic! was not well-received at the time, being one of only 12 games to receive a score of 1.0 or lower from Gamepro magazine.[CR]</plot>

The game plays similarly to Wonder Boy in Monster Land, or Falcom's own Legacy of the Wizard or Ys III, with characters exploring each stage and defeating enemies to earn money which can then be spent on better equipment or curative consumables.Originally released in 1991 for the NEC PC-9801 home computer, Falcom would eventually publish a version for the Super Famicom in 1994. The same year, Sega published a version for the Sega CD (which would later be published in the US by Working Designs in 1995) and NEC did the same for the PC Engine CD.The PC-9801 and PC Engine CD games are almost identical, though the latter benefits from the CD storage with its improved graphics, cutscenes and redbook audio. The Sega CD version increases the size of the playable character and emphasizes the combat and platforming, while streamlining the exploration aspects and aging up the cutesy characters for cutscenes. The Super Famicom version is similar to the Sega CD version, but lacks a lot of features (including the animated, voiced cutscenes) due to the limitations of the platform.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Power Monger, or Powermonger, is a god sim game from Populous creator Peter Molyneux. It builds on Populous, borrowing elements but adding a whole lot more besides, including a 3D map that can be rotated around to an extent and an "artificial life" engine that allows for complex AI behavior that occurs naturally with little amounts of input from the player.It was released on many European and Japanese home computers, as well as on the SNES, Sega Genesis and Sega CD consoles in multiple regions. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game features a 3D game map, although camera movement was limited to rotating the map in 90-degree intervals and 8 pre-defined levels of zoom. Only the map itself is three dimensional, people, trees and other game objects where comprised of sprites. The game also features a fairly advanced "artificial life" engine. Each person seem to have a mind of their own and will go about his or her job, fishing, farming, shepherding, collecting wood or making items without any input from the player. On death, citizens and soldiers alike would rise heavenwards in angelic form. The player also have a query tool that can be used to see the name, sex, age, allegiance, vital stats, hometown and equipment for any given person they click on. While the player cannot form the land, their actions can still have some limited effect on the environment. For example if the player deforests a big area the weather pattern will change and more rain or snow (depending on season) will fall, making movement slower.The player starts out on each map with a small number of soldiers, and maybe a few towns already under their control. To win the map they need to tip the balance of power completely to their side (represented by a scale below the mini-map), by conquering all (or at least most) of the towns on the map, and kill any opposing captains. Once a town is under the player's control, they can draft the locals into their army and take on bigger towns or enemy armies. Some of the bigger towns also have neutral captains and if these survive the battle and the player conquers the town they come under their command as well. The player can only control as many armies as they have captains so it's important to keep them alive - if a captain is killed his army is disbanded and his surviving solders go back to their town of origin. Unlike the main army which the main character commands, the subordinate captains have a "lag" time. The further away from the main character they are, the longer it takes for orders to reach them. When issuing orders via the captains, a useful and sometimes amusing feedback is provided: the affirmative voice sample is played at a pitch that signals the wisdom of the player's commands.Food is the single most important resource in the game, the expression "an army marches on its belly" is very true in Power Monger, therefore it is often smart to not to draft a whole town's population into an army, because an empty town will not produce food (or more people). Aside from friendly towns the player can also slaughter wandering sheep (by ordering the army to attack it), barter food from neutral towns, or kill an enemy captain and pillage his food supply. Aside from manpower and food towns can also provide equipment. Townspeople will occasionally make stuff, but to speed things up the player can order an army to "invent" at a friendly town. Depending on nearby resources and what posture the army is set to (passive, neutral or aggressive) the player's men will then go to work collecting resources and make items. As the more useful items can usually only be made in one or two towns on any given map these have great strategic importance.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia 1989Prince of Persia was originally released in 1989 for the  Apple II by  Jordan Mechner. Mechner used film of his younger brother David running, jumping, and performing many of the Prince's actions. Mechner then  rotoscoped the film to create the animations that give the  Prince his fluid movement.Part of the game's appeal was its then unique focus on  environmental puzzle-solving, as well as its one-on-one  sword duels. Mechner has stated that the game was inspired by the first ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the character's  acrobatics in a  dangerous environment.Prince of Persia has since been ported to a number of different platforms, including the  Amiga,  Apple Macintosh, DOS,  NES,  Game Boy,  Sega Genesis,  Game Gear,  SNES,  Sharp X68000,  Atari ST, and SAM Coup&#233;.The music was written by Jordan Mechner's father,  Francis Mechner.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia is a platformer with heavy emphasis on careful jumping and environmental puzzle solving. The player controls the Prince as he attempts to  rescue his princess before she  weds  Jaffar, the evil Grand Vizier. Jaffar has trapped the  Princess, and given her an hour to decide whether she wishes to marry him or die. This hour unfolds in  real time, and the only way to lose the game is to fail to reach the Princess within sixty minutes.The player is given only an hour to navigate the game's thirteen levels and rescue her. Scattered throughout each level are hidden  switches, secret  pitfalls and a variety of other hazards standing in the Prince's way of rescuing his beloved. There are also hidden  potions that have a variety of effects on the Prince.The player will have to explore and pay attention to their environment in order to solve the puzzles and make it to the end. The Prince will also have to fight his way past  guards to reach the Princess. Combat exists as a series of sword fights, which were unusual for its time when  projectile weapons were the norm.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Sultan of Persia, one day, leaves to wage war in a foreign land. His Grand Vizier, Jaffar, steps in to take his  throne while he is away. Shortly thereafter, a street urchin decides to climb the Royal Tower to see the Princess, whom people have claimed to be as beautiful as a new moon. When the young  orphan finally sees the Princess,  they fall in love. The couple intend to marry.The Vizier discovers this and decides that he wants to marry the Princess. He throws the street urchin into the lowest  dungeon and locks the Princess in the highest tower. He then gives the Princess one hour, counted on a magical  hourglass, in which she has to decide to marry the Vizier or die.The street urchin's main goal is to defeat Jaffar and reach the Princess.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The SNES versionAside from being ported to several different platforms, Prince of Persia has received  two  proper  sequels and a  3D remake.  Ubisoft re-imagined the series with its  Sands of Time  trilogy, and the French publisher again rebooted the series with a new game, titled simply  Prince of Persia. A motion picture based on  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is also being developed, Mike Newell directing, and is being produced by  Jerry Bruckheimer. The movie was released in 2010 starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, and  Ben Kingsley and was received with average reviews.The game was  ported many times, and version such as the  SNES one which improved on the original. In the SNES game, the graphics were updated, and the game was given 20 levels, and an extra hour to complete the game.The original Prince of Persia has sold over 2 million copies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 8,8,7,5 adding, "...very impressed with this version of the game. Not only were all the characters and pitfalls very easy to see on the small screen, but even the very fluid animation found on the other versions of the game was duplicated almost perfectly".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]We follow Puggsy who has crash landed on an alien planet 15 light years away from his home planet. The inhabitants of the planet have stolen his spaceship which stops him from being able to find his way home.You find your way through many levels where there is no set path and you can find your own way around, with the main objective of getting your spaceship back from 'The Racoons'[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Puggsy is a platformer, which means it works pretty much in the same way as others: Up, Down, Left, Right, Pick up, Put down, Throw. However, many of the levels involve puzzles which are required in order to progress.Puggsy uses Total Object Interaction which is the system that allows real world physics to come into play. Certain objects in the game can be picked up and used in some way to help you complete the level. You can even stack objects, such as barrels to help you reach the higher platforms. You can also throw these objects at the enemies, or even pick up a gun and shoot them. Also, the object you carry will make you weigh more, so you wont be able to jump as high depending on your weight. Each object has a different weight to it, from a balloon that will help you float to a weight that will sink you quickly.The goal of each level is to reach the exit. Optionally, you may bring items with you through the exit door to give you more points. Often times levels will involve finding a key and unlocking a chest to reach the most valuable item to take back with you.

				<plot>[CR]Fighter Aircraft[CR]Primary FightersBarnstormer - Fokker DR. 1: The ultra-maneuverable Fokker triplane was flown by the greatest combat ace of WWI, the Red Baron. It's three-wing design earned it the nickname "Tripe."Warbird - P38 Lightning: The most ominous-looking fighter of WWII, the P38 was nicknamed "Fork-Tailed Devil" by pilots who flew against it.Jet - F16 Fighting Falcon: One of the meanest multi-purpose light fighters ever made, the F16 is as much at home blasting ground targets as it is in dogfights.Upgrade FightersBarnstormer - The Spad XIII: The rugged Spad XIII was piloted by many French aces in WWI as well as by the top scoring American ace, Eddie Rickenbacker.Barnstormer - Travel-Air Mystery Ship: The "Mystery Ship" took the first Thompson Trophy Race by storm in 1929.Warbird - P51 Mustang: Many consider the Mustang to be the finest fighter of WWII.Warbird - J7W1 Shinden: The Shinden's powerful engine and "pusher" design make it a formidable combat machine.Jet - MiG29 Fulcrum: Russia's answer to NATO's front-line fighters, the Fulcrum is fast, maneuverable and deadly.Jet - F23 Black Widow: A lethal combination of stealth and firepower, the Black Widow certainly earns its name.There is also a member of the black market who sells more airplanes for you to pilot.[CR]The Game[CR]The game design is similar to Super Mario Kart. You race in seasons with the completion of each race giving you points for your position and at the end get a ranking. Also similar as you race you can fly through various power ups, such as weapons and health boosters.[CR]</plot>

You are out to avenge your father's death as well as the emperor and rescue your girlfriend from the clutches of evil and bring an end to the terror visited upon your lands.[CR]Some of the villians you face are Marco Killmore (a half man, half eagle samurai warrior), Zallen (a disgraced samurai warrior out to destroy Hayate), Vengor (a stone shiva-type character), Desfal (a medusa-like woman), Destroyer MPK (a possessed collection of samurai armor) and of course the evil samurai knight himself, Lougi.[CR]To play the game you must press the corresponding buttons on the screen at a certain time, such as pressing left to go left or possibly to avoid a enemies weapon or pressing one of the regular buttons to draw your weapon and attack a certain enemy, much like Dragon's Lair and Space Ace. There are three difficulty levels, each one giving you a certain amount of time to press the buttons, the hardest setting giving you the least amount of time.</plot>

				<title_clean>Revengers Of Vengeance</title_clean>
				<plot>Revengers of Vengeance is a combination RPG/vertical shooter/fighting game with a fantasy/anime style. There are ten available characters, each with their own animated backstory and fighting techniques. You must choose a hero and guide their stats to create a formidable fighter capable of taking down the Devil King and freeing the land.[CR]In the Quest mode, you name your selected character and start at a lowly Level 1. The local town acts as a hub with opportunities for training, equipment purchases and rest. You can leave town and battle contenders for money in the fighting game. You can advance the story by taking quests from the town's guild, which are played in the vertical shooter game.[CR]The fighting engine is further explored in two side modes - Tournament and Arena of Death. Tournament acts as a basic fighting game, allowing 1 or 2 players to progress through the ranks with the stock characters. No customization is available in this mode.[CR]Arena of Death allows eight players to be created using the stock character templates. You assign attributes by shifting various bars between two extremes. You can then match these creations against each other and watch as the computer simulates a battle between them. The primary use of this mode appears to be testing various tactics against each other to decide how best to play your character.</plot>

				<title_clean>Rise Of The Dragon</title_clean>
				<plot>Rise of the Dragon is a predominantly first-person adventure game with some action elements thrown in, much like the other adventure game released by Dynamix at about the same time,   Heart of China.  In Rise of the Dragon players take on the role of an ex-cop private detective who gets swept up in a sinister plot created by a Fu Manchu-like adversary.  While much of the style of the game borrows heavily from Blade Runner (the main character and protagonist's name is Blade, perhaps as an homage to the film) and its hard boiled spiritual predecessors (with crowded, dingy L.A. streets, seedy bars, strong Eastern influences, trench coats, and cynical attitudes), there are high adventure pulp elements as well, with broadly drawn caricatures as enemies and allies, as well as the "chosen one" trope used since prehistory and a pseudo-historical Eastern cult which vaguely resembles the   Cthulhu mythos in its modern-yet-supernatural scope.Players have access to various map locations accessible by subway trains, more of which open up as clues are uncovered and puzzles are solved.  The puzzles themselves use inventory and exploration, as well as experimentation with devices found in the environment.  There are also dialogue choices during conversations, and a few action sequences during key moments.The art style emulates certain comic book styles, with slightly exaggerated, emotive faces.  There are some photorealistic touches, such as the bitmapped photographic frames used during telephone message sequences (which is jarring when you consider that the same people who leave messages for you have comic book-style equivalent faces when you meet them in person).Some of the puzzles and events are also time-based.  Players must pay attention to a clock and calendar in the upper-right portion of the screen.  You will, for example, have a date scheduled for a day and time, and your date expects you to arrive promptly.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Road Avenger is an 1985 FMV laserdisc-based arcade game that was was developed by Data East and featured animation by Toei. While the game is known as Road Blaster in Japan, it was released internationally as Road Avenger as well as Road Prosecutor. The name change was possibly to avoid confusion with the Atari game called RoadBlasters.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Road Avenger is set in the late 1990s in a post-apocalyptic American wasteland and follows a vigilante ex-cop taking vengeance against the gang responsible for the death of his wife.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Road Avenger was an FMV interactive action movie game, essentially played as a series of enormous Quick Time Event car chases, with the player reacting to on-screen prompts/situations to steer, accelerate, and brake the car.While it has similar gameplay to other laserdisc games like Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, Ninja Hayate, and Time Gal, Road Avenger is significantly more interactive and action-packed. In Road Avenger, the player is constantly needing to react by performing various different actions at a fast pace.Road Avenger has nine levels, each ending with a ranking based on the player's reaction time.It has three difficulty modes. Hard Mode does not having any on-screen prompts at all, but the player needs to react based on the situations. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. [CR]There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.[CR]There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.[CR]If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.[CR]The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.</plot>

				<title_clean>Samurai Shodown</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Samurai Shodown (known in Japan as Samurai Spirits) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on August 11, 1993.Set in the late 18th century, Samurai Shodown is known for being the first fighting game to focus on weapon-based combat and for its style of that era's Japanese culture (including calligraphy and musical instruments). The game is also known for its quirky translation, traditional control scheme, camera zoom effects (in similar vein to Art of Fighting), randomly-dropped items (including food for healing and bombs for damage), and the Rage Meter (in which receiving damage causes the fighter to temporarily become "enraged" and more powerful).Along with being one of the few Neo Geo games to receive ports to most fourth-generation game consoles, the game spawned numerous sequels and spin-off titles throughout the Neo Geo's life cycle (making it one of SNK's most well-known game series).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A typical fight, taken from the SNES version.Players face each other one-on-one, in a 2D field that can be enlarged if the fighters are far enough from each other. Unlike other fighters, however, each character fights with a weapon, ranging from swords (in fact, most characters use swords) to spears. They can also use physical attacks (there are strong/weak attack buttons for both weapons and physical attacks), but this rarely comes up. The weapons increase the range of characters' regular attacks, and if both characters attack in a precise way, they can lock weapons. When they lock weapons, each player must rapidly press buttons to win the standstill; the loser drops their weapon, while a tie results in both players losing their weapons.Also unlike other fighters, the game featured items. They included treasure (points), food (healing), and bombs (damage). A running referee would toss them into the arena at random intervals. In addition, a referee would hold up a flag whenever one of the players took a hit; he would hold up a different colored flag depending on who got hit. This referee, named Kuroko, would become a hidden character in the Game Boy port, using his flags as weapons.Samurai Shodown also featured mini-games at regular intervals throughout the single-player mode. Players had to slash through ten straw men in the span of thirty seconds. Straw men would only stay up for a short amount of time, this amount of time lessening in later iterations of the mini-game. For the most part, cutscenes took place immediately before and after the mini-game, showing Amakusa's rise to power and his revenge against the Tokugawa. There were only two exceptions, one of them being the ending for a particular character's story.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Note: this only covers characters present in the original arcade version.AmakusaThe main villain of the first Samurai Shodown game and several games afterward, Amakusa wishes to destroy the Tokugawa and gain great magical power. Unfortunately, he is not a playable character. Amakusa has one of the widest movesets in the game, being able to launch himself like a meteor, create a boomerang-esque ball of magic energy, teleport around the stage several times, and punch at his opponents rapidly.Gen-AnA green devil, Gen-An can rush at his opponents as a spinning blade-ball, climbing the wall he hits to come back down and hit them again. Gen-An can also send a ball of poison gas at his opponents, potentially disabling them temporarily if it hits. He fights his enemies with a giant steel claw he wears on his right hand.GalfordGalford and Poppy.A San Francisco swordsman, Galford is one of two characters in the game to get assistance from an animal: his dog, Poppy. Poppy is most likely a girl, since the credits reveal that she has puppies. Like Hanzo, Galford can launch projectiles at his opponents, create holograms of himself to confuse his enemies, and disappear to strike from above. He can also send Poppy to maul other fighters.JubeiLike Hanzo, Jubei is based on a famous historical figure; in this case, he is a legendary samurai. His moveset includes multiple stabs, followed by an uppercut similar to Charlotte's, and sending a shockwave along the ground to his enemies. Jubei insists that he is not that guy from Fatal Fury.UkyoA blue-haired swordsman from Japan. Ukyo can send a fire bird down while jumping, and repeatedly slash at his opponent. He signals the latter by throwing an apple, which he rapidly slashes, as well.CharlotteA French knight, Charlotte is one of two female characters in Samurai Shodown. She is sensitive about this fact, telling opponents not to mention her plate (most likely her breast plate). After defeating Amakusa, Charlotte returns to France to aid the peasants in the French Revolution. She can perform a triangle slash, drag a green column up with her while jumping, and charge at her opponents with multiple sword thrusts.Tam-TamTam-TamA Mayan warrior always seen wearing a mask. Oddly enough, he is one of the few characters with any stake in what Amakusa is doing; after beating him, he takes the orb that Amakusa used as a weapon. This orb apparently belongs to the Mayans, and Tam-Tam uses it to heal the ailments of those around him. Tam-Tam can throw skulls, summon rising demons, and spin his flaming sword while moving toward his opponent.EarthquakeBased in Texas, Earthquake is the leader of a gang of thieves searching for treasure. In fact, upon defeating Amakusa, his three subordinates return to him with piles of treasure. He is tall, fat, and missing several teeth. Earthquake can rush toward his opponent as a spinning blade ball, or bounce toward them to harm them with his butt.NakoruruAn Ainu priestess, Nakoruru is not only one of the two female characters in the first Samurai Shodown, but also one of two characters who fight with animal friends. Her hawk, Mamahaha, can lift Nakoruru into the air, allowing her to drop down and slash her opponent. She can also rush toward her opponent, either remaining on the ground or rising up to do so.Wan-FuThe King of China, Wan-Fu is the only character who can voluntarily give up their weapon. This is done by jumping into the air and tossing a flaming sword at the opponent. Usually, when the AI does this, they run toward the sword to retrieve it. Wan-Fu can also perform an uppercut with his sword.HaohmaruHaohmaru's ending.The protagonist of the Samurai Shodown series, Haohmaru is a Japanese swordsman. His moves include sending a tornado at enemies and a type of sword uppercut. After his fight with Amakusa, Haohmaru returns to Japan and fights Mai Shiranui of King of Fighters fame.HanzoA Tokugawa ninja based on a historical figure. He can send fire toward his opponents, throw shurikens, and disappear to strike from above. After defeating Amakusa, Hanzo spends his life training other ninjas.KyoshiroA kabuki actor, Kyoshiro can toss flaming fans, spin-jump at his opponents, and use his poll to thrust himself at the opponent as a fireball.[CR]Ports[CR]The SNES port of Samurai Shodown removed a lot from the arcade original, like the blood and large battlefields.After being made for the Neo Geo, Samurai Shodown was ported to many systems. However, few were capable of running the game at the technical level that the Neo Geo did. For example, the SNES, Genesis, and Sega CD versions removed the scaling present in the original; instead, they kept the characters at a constant size (the Genesis and Sega CD used the large sprites, the SNES their small counterparts). The SNES and Genesis versions also removed the blood present in the original. The port closest to the original was the 3DO version, which kept the scaling and blood that the others lacked.In addition to a playable Amakusa, the Game Boy version had two additional unlockable characters: Kuroko, the referee, and Hikyaku, the courier man that throws item onto the battlefield. Although Kuroko would also become a playable character in later games, Hikyaku has yet to resurface in that role.Samurai Shodown would also appear in later compilations alongside other Samurai Shodown games. It was ported to the PS1 along with its sequel under the name Samurai Spirits Kenkaku Shinan Pack. However, this port was only available in Japan. However, it would also appear in Samurai Shodown Anthology for the Wii, PS2 and PSP, along with its five direct sequels.Samurai Shodown, along with II and III, were also ported to the Wii's Virtual Console. All three were ports of their Neo Geo incarnations, making it unlikely that the SNES and Genesis ports of the game will be ported, as well.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Sega Classics Arcade Collection is a compilation of four (or five) Sega Mega Drive games for the Sega Mega-CD. It was a pack-in game bundled with launch Mega CDs in the United Kingdom and North America, and was released separately in other regions.[CR]Two variants of Sega Classics Arcade Collection exist; an earlier version seen in North America and Japan, which contains Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Columns and The Revenge of Shinobi, and a later version seen in Europe and later North American bundles, which throws in Super Monaco GP. In North America the older "4-in-1" variant came in the same box as Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective Vol. I, while the later "5-in-1" one came with Ecco the Dolphin.[CR]Each game is mostly identical to their Mega Drive counterparts, though have minor changes thanks to the Mega CD's enhancements. All digitised speech samples have been replaced with higher quality audio, the first level in Golden Axe uses different instruments and Super Monaco GP has extra drums. The Revenge of Shinobi is based on a later version than its cartridge counterparts, altering some of the bosses which infringe copyrights. For unknown reasons, Golden Axe is only a one-player game in this compilation.[CR]Despite being the Mega CD's selling point, only two games have an updated CD soundtrack (Golden Axe in the form of music recorded from its arcade board, and Columns which has a new title theme). This means only a small fraction of the disc is used.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Set in the not-too-distant future, humanity has been forced to live in their underground infrastructures for unspecified reasons. Here, bands of "Sewer Jockies" group together and with the use of their armed ships, scour the tunnel systems in order to exterminate the mutated creatures that inhabit the sewers to prevent them from contaminating the above-ground resort area of Solar City.The player assumes the role of a rookie pilot and is joined by a veteran pilot, Ghost, who proceeds to berate the player for the majority of the game, and his robot scout, Catfish, who provides the player with valuable information. Throughout the game, the player receives transmissions from the owner of Solar City, Commissioner Stenchler, who will allow the player into his resort should they kill one million pounds worth of creatures.Meanwhile, a fellow jockey by the name of Falco rides into unsanctioned territory following what she describes as a "crazy looking thing," thinking it will lead her on a secret path to Solar City. Later, this creature provides the route for players as opposed to receiving this information from Catfish.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As a rail shooter, the player does not take direct control of the ship, but that of the targeting crosshair in order to shoot the various species as they appear. The player does, however, have limited control of the ship during specific navigation spots. While the directions are always different, there is only one specific route to through the sewer for each time the game is played, as specified by Catfish. Occasionally, Catfish will give the player a series of directions (3, 6, 9 or 12) which must be followed or the game will end. When approaching one of the navigation spots, the player must hold down the A button and press the appropriate direction.[CR]Original Format[CR]Originally filmed and created in 1987, Sewer Shark was one of a few games, including eventual Sega CD hit Night Trap, developed for an interactive video system called Nemo, created by Tom Zito for Hasbro. When Hasbro canceled the Nemo project, Zito purchased the rights for Night Trap and Sewer Shark back from Hasbro with the hope that they would one day see release.Years later, Sony would be developing a CD-based addon for Super Nintendo, dubbed Playstation. In search of pre-existing FMV-based games to port to the new system, members of Sony discovered Sewer Shark and wished to license it for the Nintendo Playstation. In response, Tom Zito founded Digital Pictures and worked to port Sewer Shark and Night Trap to the Nintendo add-on, as well as develop all-new FMV-based games.When Sony's development deal for the Super Nintendo add-on fell apart, Sony struck up a partnership with Sega to release the games for the upcoming Sega Genesis CD add-on, Sega CD, instead. Tom Zito would later express minor disappointment with the change, as the Sega Genesis' limitation of only showing 64 colors on screen at one time severely degraded the video quality over the Super Nintendo, which was capable of displaying up to 256 colors on screen at once.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Shining Force CD</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The story of Shining Force CD continues on from the end of the original  Shining Force on the  Sega Genesis. "A fierce battle with Dark Dragon ensued when the Runefaust Army invaded. The heroics of  Max and the Shining Force, Dark Dragon was defeated.The victors returned to their normal lives, vowing for renewed peace.Some disappeared, some left for further adventure,some returned to their homes and families and  Anri returned to her kingdom as the Queen of Gardiana. With help from  Ken,  Lug and  Lowe they rebuilt the kingdom from the ashes of the Runefaust invasion.The story begins 20 years after."After choosing a New Game, the player is asked to choose which book they wish to read from, either "Towards the Root of Evil" or "The Evil God Awakes". The books follow on from each other but there are completely separate teams for each book. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Towards the Root of EvilAnri is poisoned.Towards the Root of Evil starts in the throne room of Queen Anri where generals from the foreign land of Cypress attack her guards. Ken attempts to attack them but is ordered to stop by Anri. The lead general then presents a "gift" from the King of Cypress which ends up poisoning her.After the Gardiana army is presumed lost after being sent to attack Cypress, a group of youngsters come together to offer their services as a new Shining Force to recover a cure for Anri. Many of them are related to members of the original Shining Force, including Ken and  Hans' sons and  Gong's nephew. They are led by an outsider named Nick who came up with the plan.  Lowe also comes along as the Forces mentor, performing the same role as Sir Astral from  Shining Force 2. The Evil God Awakes  Sacrifice of the king.As the story starts, the player learns that the armies of Gardiana and Cypress have joined forces to stop the evil Iom. The game then cuts to a scene where Warderer sacrifices the king of Cypress to Iom. One of Warderer's generals, Barbara, informs him that the trap has been set for the Cypress army and it will be too late for the Gardiana army.Warderer then talks about needing the Sword of Hajya which is currently in the possession of Prince Nick of Cypress and concocts a plan to steal the sword from Cypress castle while the army marches on Iom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay consists of a series of battles interspersed with story elements. This differs from previous Shining Force games in that there is no overworld travel directly controlled by the player. In battle, the combat plays out like previous entries in the series, with each side moving its characters and then attacking with either physical or magical abilities. Once all of the enemies are defeated or in some cases, a more powerful boss enemy is destroyed, the battle ends and the story continues. Each member of the team handles very differently in battle depending on which class they are. This determines their stats, their abilities and which weapons they can wield.Once characters gain 100 experience through attacking and destroying enemies, they level up, increasing their stats. At level 10, players are able to visit the camp and have the character promoted a more powerful version of their starting class.When players visit towns between battles or when the Egress spell is used in battle, the game handles in a format similar to the town section in Shining in the Darkness, with the playable characters scrolling left to right and players being able to choose to enter locations such as the camp, to resurrect defeated team members, or to shop where new equipment can be purchased.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Silpheed</title_clean>
				<plot>The story contains some differences between the home computer versions and the later Sega CD version, making many consider the Sega CD game a sequel rather than a re-release, though the gameplay and many boss encounters are largely the same.In the home computer versions the primary antagonist is the named terrorist Xacalite, who has hijacked one Earth's finest battlecruisers, the Gloire, armed with planet buster weapons, and who over the course of the game actually blows up Earth.The Sega CD version instead tells the story of the first encounter with an unknown alien species, which upon meeting humans decide to attack (and, like in the PC version, end up destroying) Earth. The Sega CD's version of the story is also the premise for  the later games in the series, such as Silpheed: The Lost Planet for PS2 and Silpheed: Alternative AM for Android. The name of the player's ship is also different between the computer and console versions - it's name SA-08 Silpheed in the home computer version, and SA-77 Silpheed on the Sega CD.On the technical side, both the home computer and console versions of the game were very advanced for their time - the home computer version was an early showcase for real time polygonal graphics, as well as the Roland MT-32 sound card. The game and it's music on a tape were often bundled with the sound card.The Sega CD version does things slightly differently - the player's ship and the smaller enemies encountered in the game are still polygonal, but the detailed set-piece backgrounds are pre-rendered FMV, rendered in high resolutions, but low color and with a relatively low framerate in order for the console to be able to run it in full screen, the result is still a stunningly detailed, though stylized play field, where massive ships fight and blow up in the distance, and with a seamless transition between cutscenes and gameplay, with some relatively advanced camera movement that was unrivaled at the time of release, and for many years thereafter.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Sega CD version review scores of 9,7,7 and 7. Ed Semrad, who gave the highest score wrote, "...some of the most stunning visuals in a video game. The cinemas are unbelievable. The game itself is rather mundane. It is a simple shooter, that seems to lack real interaction with the amazing backgrounds. The fame play is solid, however, and there is absolutely no slowdown whatsoever. I only wish there could have been more interaction".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Snatcher is a cyberpunk adventure game, written and directed by Hideo Kojima. The player assumes the role of Gillian Seed, a new recruit to an elite police task force known as J.U.N.K.E.R. The player's goal is to investigate the emergence of the mysterious race known as the Snatchers, a race of cybernetic beings that kill humans and steal their appearance. The game takes place in the year 2046 on the artificial island of Neo Kobe 50 years after the explosion of a warhead destroyed large parts of eastern Europe in an event called the "Catastrophe." The game draws heavily from popular science fiction movies such as Blade Runner, Terminator, Akira and Aliens in both setting and character design as well as containing references to other Konami projects such as Metal Gear, Contra, Goemon and Castlevania. The game saw a remake which used a super-deformed art style with RPG style gameplay, known as SD Snatcher.Originally released for the NEC PC-8801 in Japan in 1988, the game has been remade several times for various platforms, such as the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The only English language translation was released for the SegaCD/MegaCD in Europe and America on December 15, 1994. The Sega CD version was the first to have light gun support, using Sega's Justifier light gun peripheral.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Shall I investigate Mika?Snatcher is a heavily text-based adventure, and most images are shown in a first person perspective, though there are a few cinematic shots. Throughout the game, the player is given a menu in order to interact with their environment. Most often, players have the 'Look' and 'Investigate' options available for interaction with the environment, and 'Use Metal Gear' and Inventory' options for other things. In special situations, players can speak with other characters, and show them items. At times, Gillian can also smell and search areas (or people). In most cases, the player must use choices more than once to get a complete picture of events and to move the story forward.There are special instances in the game where further interaction is available. First, there is one particular area that players can search with a flashlight. More commonly, the player must use their blaster to take down enemies. When the opportunity arises, players press a specified button to draw their weapon, and another button to fire. A grid is shown on the screen which the player navigates in order to take out enemies. Both of these sequences are not common occurrences. The game was originally meant to be played with a light gun for the shooting sequences.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Act 1: SnatchThis cyberpunk adventure begins as Gillian Seed begins his first day on the Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Ranger (J.U.N.K.E.R.) force, dedicated to protecting Humanity from murderous cybernetic criminals known as "Snatchers". We learn in the beginning that Gillian and his wife both have amnesia, and were discovered a few years prior. He and his wife, lacking memory of their relationship, are not seeing each other very often anymore. Gillian is shown around J.U.N.K.E.R. headquarters, where he meets Mika Slayton, the engineer Harry Benson, and the Chief Benson Cunningham. Gillian receives his blaster and his navigator, Metal Gear Mk.II. As soon as Gillian meets his partner, he receives a videophone call through Metal Gear from another J.U.N.K.E.R., Jean Jack Gibson. Jean Jack Gibson is in trouble, and needs help immediately. Gillian, though it is only his first day on the job, rushes off to complete his first task as a Junker. He rushes to the wreckage of an old building from which the call was made.Gillian with his blasterUpon arrival, the presence of an artificial pollen called Snow 9 is discovered, which is a sign of Snatcher presence. Gillian and Metal Gear go and explore the building, but all they find are the remains of Gibson's navigator, Little John, and Gibson's corpse. They discover that Gibson's head had been twisted off, something only a Snatcher would have the strength to do. They investigate to discover clues on both Gibson's corpse and Little John's memory bank. No Snatchers seem to be present, however, so the two move out to further investigate, hoping to identify the Snatcher that killed Gibson.Everyone at J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ is very hurt by the news that Jean Jack is dead, complicating the situation for Gillian. He consoles his comrades, and then moves forward in the investigation by searching Gibson's house. Gillian goes to Jean Jack's home, and speaks with his daughter, Katrina. While searching the home, he finds critical information regarding the identification of Snatchers. He learns that their artificial skin cannot cope with ultraviolet radiation, requiring them to operate at night, and use sunscreen at all times. As soon as he has this info, he moves out, hoping to utilize this to discover Gibson's murderer. Gillian also discovers an acquaintance of Jean Jack's, an informant codenamed "Napoleon". Napoleon provides information about Plato's Cavern and Outer Heaven, two places well known in the Neo-Kobe underground.Gillian's search leads him to a black market dealer and an underground restaurant, the only place in Neo Kobe that serves buffalo meat (which had been found in Gibson's stomach). He goes to this restaurant, Outer Heaven, and interrogates both the manager and one of the strippers. These interrogations give him a description of the man who must have killed Gibson, and Gillian and Metal Gear rush back to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ to use this description. The features described by the hooker at Outer Heaven lead Gillian to two suspects: Ivan Rodriguez and Freddy Nielsen. Gillian and Metal Gear first head to Rodriguez's apartment, located in a very rough area of town. When they get to his residence, Ivan comes out shooting. Gillian quickly disarms and interrogates him. Upon further investigation, evidence reveals that Ivan is not a Snatcher. All is not in vain, however, as Ivan is in possession of an illegal drug, explaining his actions, and he is later arrested by civilian police. Gillian now goes to find the other suspect, Freddy Nielsen.Gillian arrives at the Nielsen home only to discover Freddy isn't around. After questioning Nielsen's wife and searching for concrete evidence of Freddy's state, Gillian is attacked by his wife, who is a Snatcher. After killing her, Gillian and Metal Gear leave the scene, but as they do, a light comes on. They go back to figure out what happened, only to be attacked by Freddy Nielsen. Nielsen has Gillian by the neck, and Gillian seems helpless. Just before all hope is lost, a civilian bounty hunter, Random Hajile, saves Gillian.Act 2: CureGillian's first move in Act 2 is to find any information he can about the Snatchers' illicit hospital where they treat their skin. First, by searching the memory banks of Little John, an image of a neon sign that says 'Hospital Oleen' is discovered. For further information, Gillian seeks out Napoleon. Napoleon knows of an Oleen hospital, and provides Gillian with information on it for the right price. Gillian and Metal Gear rush to Oleen hospital, only to discover it is a veterinary clinic. Without bothering to investigate inside, they assume that the neon sign in the image from Little John must have been broken, and they need to find more clues.Benson's officeOnce the two finish speaking to Napoleon, they receive an urgent call concerning Katina Gibson. She had called in a panic earlier, requesting Gillian's help. Gillian immediately travels to her home, to find it torn apart. Gillian observes the scene, and finds evidence that it is a Snatcher's doing. When Gillian is just about to leave to find Katrina, Alice, the Gibsons' dog, is thrown through the window in a bloody mess. Hoping to find Katrina in one piece, Gillian and Metal Gear search for any place they may find her. When their search yields no results, they return to Gillian's apartment. Once the pair arrives at the apartment, they discover someone has been there.They enter cautiously and find that someone is using the bathroom. Slowly, they enter, and open the shower only to find Katrina, who quickly sprays Gillian in fright. Once she is decent, it is time for an explanation. Gillian questions Katrina, and she tells him why she came to his house, and what the Snatchers were doing in her home; She had found more clues. All three of them then attempt to figure out what was missing from Little John's image. They conclude that the Snatcher hospital is not "Oleen", rather, it is Queen's Hospital. With this newfound information, Gillian and Metal Gear head for their next destination.Upon arriving at Queen's Hospital, our heroes find a dark, abandoned building. It seems no one has been there for ages. The continue their investigation to find some interesting things in one of the rooms. They find a map of Russia, which is consistent with the Snatchers' strange obsession with Russia, and one piece of patient data left behind. The patient record is written in a complex form of Chinese, so the two need help to decode it. Once again, Gillian seeks the help of Napoleon.Gillian and Metal Gear find Napoleon at Outer Heaven. Luckily, Napoleon, a purebred Chinese man, knows the symbols on the patient record. It is a puzzle involving the periodic table. The group decodes the message, discovering the patient's name is 'Benson.' Shocked, Gillian rushes off to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ; there are only two Bensons he knows of. Unfortunately, neither the Chief nor Harry are at HQ. Gillian thoroughly searches the building for any clue, and finds a message from Harry. "Face to Face" is all that he left for them. Gillian further searches, realizing what this clue means. It refers to a painting in the Chief's office, an optical illusion, which shows both a vase and two faces. Gillian investigates, and discovers an image of Red Square in Moscow behind the painting. Believing that the Chief is probably a Snatcher, they leave to try and track him down. As they are leaving, they receive a videophone call from Gillian's wife, Jamie Seed. She has somehow discovered that Queen's Hospital installed a basement. This must be where they are operating from! Gillian and Metal Gear rush back to the hospital.All does not go as planned, however. As soon as they begin driving the turbocycle, they discover it has been sabotaged. Gillian constantly struggles to find a way to stop the vehicle, but to no avail. Once again, Random Hajile comes to the rescue just before Gillian meets his end. Random joins the two, and they head to the hospital.Once they arrive, they immediately search for and find the secret basement. They search all around, and eventually come across the Snatchers' morgue, containing four Human corpses. Metal Gear analyzes the bodies, to identify them and find out if the Snatchers had assumed their identities. The first two bodies are the Nielsens, the second is Chin Shu Oh, who once ran the hospital... and the third to Chief Benson Cunningham. With this new discovery, the three attempt to leave, only to encounter Chin Shu Oh and other Snatchers. All hope seems lost, but Random has one last trick up his sleeve. He tells Gillian to escape through a nearby ventilation shaft, and he uses explosives attached to himself to take down the building in a suicide attack.After the explosion, Gillian and Metal Gear find themselves in a long shaft, and observe that it was likely used by Snatchers to travel. They go further down to find it connects to an abandoned subway rail, which the Snatchers must have used to get around. They walk through the Snatcher Underground Railroad, looking for an exit. They eventually come across a ladder, which appears to take them out. They use this ladder, only to end up in the Nielsens home. They conclude this must have been how Freddy Nielsen entered the home without being noticed to attack Gillian. They had to get back to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ immediately, and leave.NapoleonTo get back to HQ, Gillian calls up a taxi. When Gillian requests he be taken to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ, the driver acts strangely. It turns out that the driver is actually Chin Shu Oh, and Gillian takes him out. Once that is over, they rush off to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ in the comandeered taxi.When Gillian arrives, he finds that someone has attacked HQ. Mika has been locked into her pod, and Metal Gear attempts to open it. Once open, they find Mika unconscious. They revive her, and she tells them that Harry ran in after Chief Cunningham, and locked the door behind. She allows them to go inside, and they dash inside to help Harry. Gillian and Metal Gear find Harry laying in a pool of his own blood. Harry tells them how he discovered that the Chief was a Snatcher, but was no match for the murderous robot. Harry then dies in Gillian's arms. Enraged, Gillian is determined to get revenge for Harry's death. Once again, he searches HQ. Gillian finds the Chief clinging to the ceiling of his office, and kills him.Act 3: JunkAct 3 begins with Gillian, Metal Gear, and Mika going over all that has happened up to that point. They discuss the Snatchers' weaknesses, those who have been discovered to be Snatchers, and the mysterious information that has been gathered. Upon studying all they know, they notice some actual links between the Snatchers and Russia, the country they're so obsessed with. It seems the Snatchers all consider this place their home.At this time, Metal Gear reveals that he actually knows all about Gillian and his mysterious past. Gillian and his wife Jamie were found cryogenically frozen in a Russian facility near the spot where the Catastrophe, a nuclear attack that devastated all of Europe, had occurred. There was one other pod, but it was empty. Jamie and Gillian both had amnesia as a result of the cryogenic suspension, and knew nothing. After inexplicably moving to Japan, Gillian joined the J.U.N.K.E.R. squad hoping it would help him recover their lost memories. Gillian also discovers that Harry Benson was he and Jamie's fully grown son.Shocking revelationsThe three decide to find the place that the Snatchers are gathered in Neo-Kobe. The conclude it must be in an area near a river from which Snow 9 originates, and a place easily accessible through the subway tunnels. All signs point to the Snatchers hiding in an old abandoned chapel, which somehow seems to line up with the Moscow river. Gillian, deciding this must be the secret hideout of the Snatchers, rushes to the scene.Unfortunately for the J.U.N.K.E.R.s, time is short. The Kyoto Summit discussing the Snatcher problem is getting together, and in approximately three hours, all authority J.U.N.K.E.R. has will be dissolved. They would also vote whether or not to completely destroy Neo-Kobe with nuclear weapons to end the Snatcher threat once and for all. Gillian must work quickly.Once Gillian and Metal Gear arrive, they find the church empty. The enter, and see a portrait of a man called "Modnar," who is clearly Random Hajile. They go further in, and find the snatchers being prepared to act as humans. They find data planning to snatch and replace many major world leaders and Gillian himself. With little time left, Metal Gear psychotically reveals that if ordered to by Kyoto, he will murder Gillian. Gillian asks Metal Gear to go out and attempt to convince the delegates in Kyoto to give him more time. Metal Gear agrees, and leaves Gillian to continue by himself.Gillian moves on, and encounters numerous Snatchers. He kills them and moves into the final chamber, where he finds Jamie, who explains how she was captured and taken to work on the development of a perfect artificial skin for the Snatchers with Dr. Modnar. Dr. Modnar was well past 100 years of age, however, and had passed on minutes before Gillian's arrival. Jamie cries about how she did it because they threatened to take their son's life, and Gillian tells her how their son, Harry, was already murdered by the Snatchers.Taking out a SnatcherAnother man reveals himself at this point. An old man in a wheelchair, Dr. Elijah Modnar. He had captured is father, the elder Dr. Modnar, to perfect his snatchers. He describes to Jamie and Gillian how he was recruited long ago to work on this project with them to simulate humans. The Snatchers were intended as a means of taking power over all other nations, the ultimate weapon. He worked on the team with Jamie, and fell in love with her. At one point in time, his only motivation to work was his love for her. Later, Gillian was hired to work with the psychological properties of the Snatchers. Jamie and Gillian fell in love and were married. Elijah was furious at this, and plotted to end it all. He set off the massive weapon Lucifer Alpha, creating the Catastrophe, and had Gillian and Jamie join him in cryogenic freezing. His plan was to leave Gillian frozen, and awaken Jamie so they could live together in peace. When he final woke up, however, he could not bring himself to do it. Instead he worked day after day, observing her silent, peaceful state. He had also realized that there would be no way he could convince her to carry on working after she realized that he'd killed billions of people because he was jealous of her love, so he left her and Gillian in suspension. Eventually, he fled, and Gillian and Jamie's bodies stayed in stasis for many years, so long that amnesia was a side effect, before they were discovered, setting the events of the game in motion.Elijah continued working on the snatchers, but could never perfect the skin. He knew his father could finish the job, so he sought his help. However, his father refused. This was no problem, as Elijah Modnar had discovered a "kinetic being" like a Snatcher, created by his father. He reveals that Random Hajile was this perfect robotic being, and by taking a sample of his skin, Elijah Modnar could perfect his snatchers and carry out his plans.The combat gridMetal Gear, strapped with explosives, appears at the scene. The delegates in Kyoto had agreed not to take action if this chapel was destroyed. In ten minutes, a blast would be sent destroying the chapel, which would qualify as Kyoto taking action. Multiple Snatchers appear to stop Jamie and Gillian's escape. Once more, Random Hajile comes to the rescue, though he was thought dead. He takes Elijah Modnar by the neck, and demands that the Snatchers stand down and let Jamie and Gillian escape. They agree, and the two escape just in time, right as the church is obliterated.The closing scene of Snatcher has Gillian and Jamie discussing their plans for the future. Gillian is preparing to take a short trip to Russia to try and regain his memory. He and Jamie plan to live together once again. Mika and Katrina come to wave him off and congratulate him on his successful mission. Mika reveals that the J.U.N.K.E.R. squad will remain intact, with a new Chief. As Gillian is about to leave, a newly fashioned Metal Gear arrives. Random dived upon him, saving him from the blast.[CR]Version Differences[CR]The first release of Snatcher was in 1988 for the NEC PC-8801 and MSX2, both on floppy disks. In order for consistent sound, the MSX2 version included an audio cartridge. Both versions ended at Act 2. The PC Engine version added the 3rd Act in addition to improving graphics and sound thanks to the CD-ROM's expanded capabilities.The Sega CD was the first iteration to support any type of light gun, utilizing Sega's Justifier.Only acceptable if this girl is 18 years or older.Some of the main changes in the English localized version of Snatcher were the result of different censorship policies in each country. The American version saw Katrina's age changed from 14 to 18, due to a shower scene and Gillian's treatment of her. At one point in Japanese version, a bare breast was shown, and it was covered up in the English version. Certain animations were also cut, such as the twitching of decapitated corpses in the game. The English version also saw customers at Outer Heaven dressed as Konami characters, while the Japanese title had the guests dressed as sci-fi characters, a change made to avoid legal problems in the west. Another change to avoid legal problems was the appearance of the Snatchers themselves, who got an overhaul in appearance to tone down their originally deliberate resemblance to the Terminator. Gillian's eye colour is changed from brown to blue in the English SEGA CD version, most likely for aesthetic purposes.Another great change was to Act 3, which was originally very uninteractive. While it still has much less player interaction then the other chapters, player interaction was added to involve the player in the final chapter of the game. The ending was improved and expanded, and a longer intro scene was added.The murder of Alice the dog in the Japan-only PS1 release of Snatcher was changed to a more decent depiction when compared to the Sega CD version; while the Sega CD shows Alice's corpse from the front, her intestines leaking from her torso, the PS1 version shows her from behind, only showing a pool of blood.[CR]Connections to Other Games[CR]Snatcher is filled with references to other Konami titles.In the Japanese version of the game, the guests inside Outer Heaven were dressed as characters from famous science fiction franchises, but these were changed to Konami characters in the English release, including Goemon from The Legend of the Mystical Ninja, Simon Belmont and Dracula from Castlevania, and Lance and Bill from Contra.The script was translated into English by Jerry Blaustein, who later translated Metal Gear Solid.The game's manual (English Sega CD) was done by Kevin O'Donohue, who did the manual for Metal Gear.There's a Moai Head mask in Napoleon's shop in reference to Konami's Gradius series shmup.The restaurant which Gillian visits for information multiple times is named Outer Heaven, the name of Big Boss's haven in the Metal Gear seriesGillian's navigator is Metal Gear Mk.II, inspired by the bipedal tanks which lend their namesake to the Metal Gear games. A non-sentient robot tool appears in Metal Gear Solid 4 as one of Solid Snake's pieces of equipment, also known as Metal Gear mk. II.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack to Snatcher was first composed by Kukeiha Club, Konami's in-house sound production team and published by King Records in 1989. It contains the MIDI sequenced soundtrack found on the MSX and PC-8801 versions of the game and features English narration throughout the album. The soundtrack for the Sega CD version was arranged by Kazuo Hashi and Yuzo Hayashi and features a more vibrant sound due to the Sega CD's cutting edge 32khz audio chip. It was released in 1992 as The Cyber Punk Adventure Snatcher -Zoom Tracks- and is the version most players will be familiar with.SnatcherSnatcherTotal length: 49:54AD 2042 Neo Kobe CityBio HazardTwilight of Neo Kobe CityEvil RippleTheme of SnatcherCreeping Silence ~Criminal Omen~ Danger Dance... &amp; Justice AllInnocent GirlTheme of JaimeDecadence BeatThe Entrance To Hell ~ Theme of IzabelTheme of KatherineTheme of JunkerBlow Up TricycleSpreading Diehard ~ Eternal Promise (Goodbye Randam)Faded MemoriesRestoration ~ Pleasure of Tention ~ Endless PursuerBeyond SorrowsMaster of Puppets Among The DiseaseTheme of EndingSnatcher: The Syber Punk Adventure -Zoom Tracks-The Syber[sic] Punk Adventure Snatcher -Zoom Tracks-Total length: 44:32Bio HazardOne Night In Neo Kobe CityTwilight of Neo Kobe CityTheme of SNATCHER (Part 1)Theme of SNATCHER (Part 2)Theme of JamiePleasure of TensionFaded MemoriesEternal Promise (Good-Bye Randam)Beyond SorrowsTear-stained Eyes [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sonic the Hedgehog, about to go fast.Sonic CD (known in Japan as "Sonic the Hedgehog CD") is a 2D action platformer developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega CD on September 23, 1993 (in Japan), October 1993 (in Europe), and November 19, 1993 (in North America).Along with the traditional gameplay of early Sonic the Hedgehog games, Sonic CD features the concept of time travel, allowing Sonic to alter the course of a given level's history by traveling through time and making changes to the past. The game also includes redbook audio (with separate soundtracks for the Japan/PAL and North American releases), a Time Attack mode, and animated FMV introduction and ending movies produced by Toei Animation.Sonic's adventure revolves around "Little Planet", a miniature planet which is believed to contain unique time shifting properties. After his nemesis, Dr. Robotnik, tethered the planet to a mountain over a giant lake and began conquering its past using its weak temporal boundaries, Sonic must traverse the planet and free it from Dr. Robotnik's control while rescuing his captured love interest, the pink hedgehog Amy Rose, from his robotic rival Metal Sonic.Sonic CD was later ported to the PC (on computers using Windows 95) in 1996 (later re-released by Expert Software) and was included in the Sonic Gems Collection compilation for the PlayStation 2 (outside North America) and GameCube in 2005.Tails in the downloadable 2011-2012 version of Sonic CD.An enhanced port, developed by independent game developer Christian "Taxman" Whitehead, was released for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade on December 14, 2011), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network on December 20, 2011), Android devices (on December 14, 2011), iOS devices (on December 15, 2011), PC (via Steam on January 19, 2012), Windows Phone devices (on November 9, 2012), and Ouya (on August 1, 2013). The game engine used for the port was re-developed from scratch, maintaining the original feel while adding widescreen display support, optional Spin Dash controls from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (in which the player gains speed by tapping the jump button repeatedly), the option to choose between the Japanese/PAL and North American soundtracks, and the inclusion of Miles "Tails" Prower as a secret playable character. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The core gameplay of Sonic CD is very similar to other Sonic the Hedgehog games at the time. The premise is to traverse a series of obstacles and enemy robots (while collecting golden rings and power-ups) to reach each stage's goal. Unlike other platformers, Sonic's speed gives him the momentum to traverse through these environments at a fast pace, though most levels are built in a way to limit that to promote exploration, and even the time travel mechanic is often used as an obstacle to hinder the player.Sonic using his Super Peel-Out technique to enter a loop at a very fast speed.The player moves Sonic left and right using the directional pad and jumps using any Jump button. Holding up on the d-pad lets Sonic look up (temporarily shifting the screen upwards) while holding down on the d-pad lets Sonic crouch (temporarily shifting the screen downwards if held down long enough) Crouching while moving causes him to curl up into a ball (known as the Super Spin Attack), reducing his friction against the ground while allowing him to destroy most enemies (whereas running into them will damage Sonic instead). Jumping also curls him up into a ball, allowing him to destroy most enemies whenever airborne. The Jump button can also be used in certain levels for interacting with objects (such as the pinball flippers in Collision Chaos Zone).Sonic has two techniques that allow him to instantly gain momentum from a fixed position. The first, returning somewhat from Sonic the Hedgehog 2, is the Spin Dash (known in Sonic CD as the Super Spin Dash), which is performed by holding down on the d-pad and pressing the Jump button. After releasing the d-pad, Sonic moves forward (in a speed determined by how long the d-pad was held) while doing his Super Spin Attack. The second technique is the Super Peel-Out, which is performed by holding up on the d-pad and pressing the Jump button. The Super Peel-Out is the same as the Super Spin Dash, except that it propels Sonic faster at the cost of his Super Spin Attack (causing him to be vulnerable to enemies).Hitting most enemies while not performing one of the Spin Attacks (or hitting certain enemies and hazards regardless) causes Sonic to do both of two things: Lose all of his possessed rings (but allow him to re-collect some of the rings that fell out of him this way) and stun him momentarily, or (if he does not have any rings in his possession) lose a life and begin again from a checkpoint. However, the player immediately loses a life every time he is crushed between moving objects, falls down the bottom of the level (which is rare in Sonic CD), drowned underwater (spending a lot of time underwater without touching large air bubbles), and spends more than ten minutes in the current life on the current stage. If Sonic loses all of his lives, it's Game Over. Sonic begins the game with three lives, and can earn lives by either collecting 1-Up power-ups, collecting 100 rings, or earning 50,000 points.As a hidden easter egg, an instant Game Over can occur if the player leaves Sonic idle (and unpaused) for more than three minutes at one time (in which Sonic says "I'm outta here!" and leaps off the screen). Time TravelDestroy these robot teleporters to save the future!Sonic CD is the only game in the original series to include the concept of time travel as an in-game mechanic. By passing a signpost marked "PAST" or "FUTURE", Sonic would be charged with mysterious energy. The ''PAST'' or ''FUTURE'' symbol at this point appears on the bottom of the screen. While in possession of this signpost, if Sonic could maintain a high-level speed for several seconds (which is difficult to accomplish intentionally, as losing that momentum at any point for the last few seconds after attaining would cause Sonic to lose the energy and the sign), he would be whisked off to a different time era, featuring a permutated version of the same level. The level may include new obstacles, enemies, and puzzles. There are four permutations for each stage:Present - The default era for the first two stages of each Zone. Includes both "PAST" and "FUTURE" signposts and non-functioning "robot teleporters".Past - A primitive-looking version of the stage. Includes only "FUTURE" signposts, functioning "robot teleporters" (which can be destroyed, saving the future of that stage and causing all enemies in the Past to disappear), and functioning holograms of Metal Sonic tormenting animals (which can also be destroyed).Bad Future - A ruined dystopia (which Dr. Robotnik rules) that is the default era for the third stage of each Zone (assuming the player did not destroy the "robot teleporter" in each of the two preceding stages). Bad Future can be accessed in other stages if the player travels to the future and did not destroy the "robot teleporter" in the past. Includes only "PAST" signposts.Good Future - A shining utopia with minimal enemies and obstacles. The default era for the third stage of each Zone (if the player destroyed both "robot teleporters" in the preceding stages). Can be accessed in other stages if the player travels to the future and did destroy the "robot teleporter" in the past. Includes only "PAST" signposts.If either all fourteen "robot teleporters" are destroyed or the player collecting all seven Time Stones in the special stages, then the player receives a "good ending" at the end of the game. Otherwise, the player receives a "bad ending". Destroying all fourteen holograms of Metal Sonic shows a hidden congratulation at the end of the game. Special StagesSonic running towards a UFO in a special stage.If Sonic crosses a goalpost with 50 rings held, the player can choose to play a special stage by letting Sonic jump into a giant golden ring close to the goalpost. Special stages are three-dimensional Mode 7 courses in which Sonic (shown in third-person perspective) must run around and collide with six flying UFOs (usually by jumping) in a limited amount of time while avoiding time-consuming obstacles.Each of the six UFOs, when destroyed, grant Sonic either a group of coins (for scoring purposes) or a Power Sneaker powerup, allowing Sonic to run faster through the course for a short period of time. If the time dwindles down to 20 seconds, a blue UFO appears near the center of the course which, if destroyed, grants Sonic 30 extra seconds.Each of the seven courses are filled with different terrain that either help or hinder Sonic's progress. Grass and rough patches of gravel, for example, slow down Sonic. Water not only slows Sonic down, but increases the rate at which the timer goes down (as well as take away 10 seconds on each landing on the water). Fans slowly propel Sonic upwards (allowing him to take out UFOs easier) while springs quickly propel Sonic upwards (allowing him to reach a farther distance quicker). Spiked pits cause Sonic to fall to the ground and lose some rings. ZonesDoing good in Tidal Tempest.Palmtree Panic ZoneCollision Chaos ZoneTidal Tempest ZoneQuartz Quadrant ZoneWacky Workbench ZoneStardust Speedway ZoneMetallic Madness ZoneWhile the final game has seven stages, data from the PC version's CD-ROM disc reveals that there was an eighth stage in development (between Palmtree Panic and Collision Chaos). Clues regarding what this stage could have been is hidden in the game (from the "Little Planet" artwork on loading screens featuring a cactus-filled desert region, to a clip in the credits video featuring dilapidated ruins). The 2011 remake, developed by Christian "Taxman" Whitehead, was originally going to include a bonus level based on the concept (titled "Desert Dazzle") and a new final stage (titled "Final Frenzy", which was only accessible by collecting all seven Time Stones and allowed Sonic to travel through time without needing signposts), but both were redacted by Sega. [CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The cover for the North American soundtrack, titled after the game's main American theme.Sonic CD was the first Sonic game to feature full CD-quality redbook audio, and two versions of the soundtrack exist: the original Japanese soundtrack (composed by Naofumi Hataya and Masafumi Ogata), and the American soundtrack (composed by Spencer Nilsen, David Young, and Mark Crew).Every stage in the game has four themes: Original, Past Mix, Good Future Mix, and Bad Future Mix, each played on each of the four permutations of the stage. While the Original, Good Future Mix, and Bad Future Mix are redbook and different for each soundtrack, the Past Mix uses the Sega Genesis's PCM synth audio, which is the same for all soundtracks (and is based on the Japanese soundtrack).The main themes for the Japanese soundtrack, also used in the European version of the game, are "Cosmic Eternity - Believe in Yourself" by Naofumi Hataya and "Sonic - You Can Do Anything" by Masafumi Ogata. Both features lyrics by Casey Rankin and vocals by Keiko Utoku. The primer one is used at the game's introduction sequence and the latter one is used at the game's ending sequence. The 2011 enhanced port uses an instrumental version of these themes.The main theme for the American soundtrack is "Sonic Boom" by Spencer Nilsen, featuring vocals by Pastiche. Used in the game's introduction, ending, and title sequences, the track would later be included in the soundtrack for Super Smash Bros. Brawl (as one of the themes for Sonic the Hedgehog's stage). [CR]Development History[CR]After the completion of Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991, Yuji Naka was not happy. His parent company, Sega of Japan, paid its employees based on their seniority - those who worked at the company longer got paid more than the new recruits, and in the grand scheme of things Naka was still considered fairly new, despite having been a key figure in launching one of Sega's biggest franchises. He quit his job at Sega of Japan - but not before being lured to Sega of America by Mark Cerny. Mark Cerny was part of the " Sega Technical Institute", a program/development team whose ultimate goal was to bring overseas developers in to impart their wisdom to the relatively inexperienced American designers. With Naka came a number of other key Sonic Team staff, and it was here at Sega Technical Institute that groundwork was laid for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 - a game that was to be much larger in scope than the original Sonic, with nearly three times as many levels, two playable characters, split-screen multiplayer, and a time travel mechanic.Back on the other side of the globe, the original character designer for Sonic and Dr. Eggman, Naoto Ohshima, was offered the opportunity to make his own Sonic 2 at Sega of Japan for their up-and-coming hardware add-on, the Sega CD. Given that the majority of Sonic Team was in America working on Sonic 2, Ohshima had to assemble his own team out of Sega of Japan's roster of designers, lending the game a unique flavor separate from the Sega Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog games. Ohshima and his Japan team took the concept of time travel and ran with it, developing a gameplay mechanic around traveling back in to the past in order to alter the status of the future.Sonic CD concept art for "Metal Sonic"Whereas Sonic 2 introduced Tails, Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose and Metal Sonic, brought to life by Kazuyuki Hoshino; his first job in what would become a long lasting relationship with Sonic Team. Though the game originally started life as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega CD, the two projects had diverged so dramatically in style and mechanics (especially after Sonic 2 saw cuts that nixed its time travel concept) that the game was eventually renamed simply "Sonic CD". The game was originally intended to launch shortly after the original Sonic the Hedgehog, but Sega felt it was more important to release Sonic the Hedgehog 2 first, delaying the fully-completed Sonic CD almost a full year beyond its originally intended launch date, instead using the game to fill the gap between Sonic 2 and Sonic 3. [CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Whitehead's "Desert Dazzle" concept art.Putting a Sonic CD disc in to a PC CD-ROM drive reveals at least one level was cut from the game's level roster. The data for each level in the game is organized by numbered folders, starting at "r1" up to "r8". However, the "r2" folder is missing, jumping from "r1" directly to "r3". Clues regarding what this stage may have looked like are hidden all over the game; the "Little Planet" artwork used on some loading screens features a cactus-filled desert region that is never actually seen in-game, and the extended version of the credits video showcases Sonic leaping through dilapidated ruins before confronting a giant Ant-lion robot, similar in appearance to the first boss of Sonic 2 for the Sega Game Gear. In Christian Whitehead's 2011 remake of Sonic CD, he was originally going to include a level based on this lost "r2" concept named "Desert Dazzle", but Sonic Team felt it would be better if the game stayed true to the original Sega CD release.Upon entering the game's "Debug Mode" Cheat Code, you see artwork of Miles "Tails" Prower standing next to a jeep with the text, "See you next game - Judy Totoya". Judy Totoya was a pen name sometimes used by Yasushi Yamaguchi, original character designer for Tails. "See you next game" is in reference to the game's original, "before Sonic 2" release date. In Christian Whitehead's Sonic CD update, this "See you next game" artwork is displayed when the player unlocks the ability to play as Tails.In an effort to tie Sonic CD to the upcoming wave of Sonic the Hedgehog comic books and TV shows, Sega of America renamed Amy Rose in the original English Sonic CD game manual to "Princess Sally". This was later retconned by the aforementioned Archie comic books, who restored her name back to Amy Rose.The character of Amy Rose is most likely derived from the Japanese Shogaku Yonensei Sonic the Hedgehog Manga. It featured a mild-mannered hedgehog named Nicky who would turn in to the super hero "Sonic" when his friends were in danger. Nicky's girlfriend was named Amy.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Ace is Don Bluth's less-successful follow up to Dragon's Lair. Much of the same development team from Dragon's Lair worked on Space Ace, and the arcade cabinet utilized the same Laserdisc technology. For Space Ace, Bluth set out to push the Laserdisc technology beyond what he had previously showcased in Dragon's Lair, primarily by making greater use of its random-access abilities to create numerous branching pathways. Instead of building one linear sequence, and killing the player if they missed an action, the game could often incorporate a "miss" into its narrative and continue on.Just as was tried with the randomization of sequences in Dragon's Lair, the idea was that a player could have a different experience on the second, third, or even tenth play - in this case, checking out content they missed in the previous play. Space Ace was also designed to have a greater emphasis on story and characterization. To this point, unlike in Dragon's Lair, all the scenes happen in a specific order, with the occasional branching opportunities appearing within. This was done to address the "collection of disjointed scenes" criticism of Dragon's Lair.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Kimberly and Ace.The player controls the titular Space Ace on the trail of an evil alien mastermind named Borf. Borf has developed a new weapon, the "Infanto Ray", which he intends to use to enslave the population of Earth. While scouting Borf's space station, Ace's gal, Kimberly, is kidnapped and Ace himself is hit with the Infanto Ray. The ray transforms him into a lanky kid named Dexter, and leaves him in a state of fluctuating between these two forms.The player must fly, shoot, and dodge their way through Borf's lair, save Kimberly, reverse the effects of the Infanto Ray, and put a stop to Borf's plans for good.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is essentially identical to what was introduced in Dragon's Lair. The player has a joystick to select directions, and a "Shoot" button to perform actions. Animation plays up to a decision point, at which time the player has a second or less to react before the game will branch to a new path, or Ace will lose a life.Sections of the animation will quickly flash yellow to indicate both when and how the player should react. If a door on the left flashes, the player should flick the stick left to travel through the door. The action Ace will take after a successful move is often unpredictable, with the intention being that Ace's antics will surprise and entertain the player. If the player misses an action that results in death, they lose a life from their stock of 3 and must restart at the beginning of that section.Space Ace's main hook is its transforming protagonist. The player defaults to Dexter, whose cannot use a weapon, and whose sections are therefore based around dodging and avoiding hazards. Numerous times throughout the adventure, the player will get the option to "Energize". If they press the Shoot button in time, Dexter will transform into Ace, a muscular hero who can use his laser pistol to blast through enemies. Due to the branching pathway technology, if the player does not transform into Ace, they will often continue on an altered path as Dexter.Space Ace also introduced difficulty levels (Cadet, Captain, and Ace) whereas Dragon's Lair had only one. The difficulty levels were intended to make the game accessible to a wider audience, however, this was achieved by simply skipping over the more difficult sections. Nearly half the available scenes are playable on Cadet, and roughly 2/3rds on Captain, forcing players to master the Ace difficulty to see all the content.[CR]Presentation[CR]As with Dragon's Lair, hand-drawn cell animation was used running at 24 frames a second - the same as with an animated feature film. Colors were vibrant and detail unsurpassed by anything standard arcade hardware (or computers) could generate or display. A few of the sequences used models for rotoscoping, namely the spaceships, motorcycle, and tunnel and rocket skates scenes.Dragon's Lair's Chris Stone provided the soundtrack, this time more theatrical, continuous, and now recorded and presented in stereo. Space Ace features more dialogue than Dragon's Lair, so Bluth's studio did look for professional voice talent. In the end, to save money, they decided again to pull voices from within the studio. The sole professional voice talent is Michael Rye, reprising his role from Dragon's Lair as the game's narrator.Space Ace - Jeff Etter (animator)Dexter - Will Finn (animator/story)Kimberley - Lorna Pomeroy (animator)Borf - Don Bluth[CR]Versions[CR]Atari ST version.Initial ports were for home computers, and shipped on multiple floppy disks. The Laserdisc's cell animation was redrawn with less detail into computer sprites, and many levels reworked or redesigned to accommodate the hardware. Cutscenes were removed due to space limitations, so nearly all sequences cut sharply to the next, without transitions. Branching pathways are also removed, with some scenes altered and made more linear (for example, Dexter doesn't need to change to Ace to shoot the pistol).SNES versionThe SNES received the only console port of that generation, and replicated the arcade Laserdisc's vibrant colors with some success. However, gameplay is the most radically revised for this version - becoming essentially a platform title with new shooting sequences. Scenes are redesigned or invented for this version, with a focus on side-scrolling mechanics, and the player now controls Dexter/Ace fully at all times instead of making decisions at key points. Platform hopping and top-down shooting make up the basic gameplay here.Sega CD version.With the advent of CD-ROM based consoles, ports of the original Laserdisc game made the rounds with varying degrees of quality. The Sega CD release naturally featured the most compressed video, but the gameplay was largely intact. Modern releases, such as for iOS, use advanced video compression to the same effect. Digital Leisure also released a DVD version of the game, playable in most home DVD players by using the arrow keys on the remote. A similar Blu-Ray release of Space Ace and Dragon's Lair was completed in 2008.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Though Don Bluth set out to make a game that surpassed Dragon's Lair as a true showcase of animation, most arcade owners weren't impressed. Ace's increased difficulty level was cited as a problem, as was the decision to originally only offer Space Ace as a new cabinet (rather than a conversion kit). Space Ace also had the misfortune of hitting in the center of the 1983-84 video game crash, when consumer interest in the entire industry was noticeably suffering.Owners also seemed less interested in a different, but similar, game to the original Dragon's Lair as they were in an actual sequel for it. Bluth's studio would go on to put the advancements made in Ace to use in Dragon's Lair II.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Theatrical-style poster for Space Ace.Don Bluth decided to market Space Ace in a way that was new to arcade owners, but tried-and-true in the movie business - designing extensive press books and press kits to promote the game in the same way as a feature film. Theatrical movie posters were even printed up and distributed to arcade owners.The game often contradicts itself as to whether Dexter is a young Ace (and his real name), or a separate character. Kimberly occasionally calls Ace "Dexter", supporting the former, while the intro attract mode suggests Ace is trapped inside a kid's (Dexter's) body.[CR]System Requirements (Steam Release)[CR]PCMinimumOS: Windows XP SP3Processor: 1.8 GHz dual core CPUMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 256 MB GeForce 8800, Radeon 3850, or Intel HD 2000 GraphicsDirectX&#174;: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardRecommendedOS: Windows 7Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.2 GHz, or AMD Athlon 64 at 2.2 GHzMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 512 MB GeForce 220, Radeon 4550, Intel HD 3000 GraphicsDirectX&#174;: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardMacMinimumOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core Duo ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceRecommendedOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core i Series ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD space[CR]</plot>

				<plot>StarBlade was released in arcades in 1991, developed and published by Namco. The game featured a pod, which was developed by Panasonic, in which the user played inside which had become a growing trend in arcade games. However, the inside of the pod is what StarBlade became famous for. StarBlade used a concave mirror to reflect the image from the screen to the top of the pod. This feature was meant to give a deep space feel and StarBlade was the first video game to ever implement the idea. The pod also featured surround sound with four speakers. The game was played with a large 2-axis 4-button controller that acted as a laser gun. The controller's built in LED lights flashed every time an enemy was destroyed. In contrast, when the player was hit by enemies, the seat would rumble and flashes would temporary blind the player. StarBlade was later ported to the Sega CD and 3DO, obviously without the pod. These versions used full motion video backgrounds with polygonal overlays to approximate the arcade graphics. The Sega CD version features wireframe enemies as opposed to shaded enemies. Two years later, the game was also ported to the PlayStation under the name, StarBlade Alpha. The Playstation version features an additional campaign, hence the changed title.An emulated version of the arcade game is included in Tekken 5 on the Playstation 2 as the loading screen mini-game and as a bonus feature.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Star Wars - Rebel Assault</title_clean>
				<plot>Rebel Assault was a CD-ROM showcase title for Lucasarts, making use of full motion video in both cutscenes and gameplay sections. It is essentially an on-rails shooter in that the player's only means of interaction are pointing and shooting (either with a joystick or mouse), and the occasional branching path selection.  An arcade experience is clearly what was intended, as opposed to the more sim-like aspects of the X-Wing series. The CD-ROM format also meant that the game could make use of music and sounds from the Star Wars movies to a much larger degree.  The story is original, blending elements from Episode IV and Episode V.  The player character is named Rookie One.  Rookie One is somewhat analgous to Luke Skywalker, though the story is build around various set pieces from the films.  For example, the player Pilots a Snowspeeder on Hoth, helping defend the base against Imperial Walkers (a la Empire Strikes back) but the game ends with the Death Star confrontation from A New Hope.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The dreaded Draxon race has been at it again, pushing the human race around, working to either enslave all 10 billion humans or wipe them out completely. As the last surviving pilot sent on a mission to thwart the Draxons' plans, all hope rests on you. Invade each of the fortified moons orbiting the Draxons' homeworld of Arctaurus and then aim for the mother planet itself.[CR]The action takes place in your hovermorph craft. In the game's introduction, the ship proves to be a deadly starfighter. When it enters the moon's atmosphere and approaches the surface, the hovermorph transforms into a powerful hovership. Blast away Draxon enemies, both ground- and air-based, from a first-person perspective on a 3D polygonal battlefield.</plot>

				<plot>DATELINE -- 1998In the post gulf war era, there's no safe harbor. Battles are no longer contained. There are no front lines. Enemy soldiers are trained terrorists who are securely settled in the middle of civilian populations. They are ready to strike at any instant.To penetrate this inner sanctum of evil, the UN created an elite team of special forces known as SURGICAL STRIKE. With the effectiveness of a mechanized marine battalion, each unit can boast 4 highly trained specialists (including the player) with advanced recon, weapons and vehicles (attack hovercraft) specifically designed for stealth, speed and firepower in any area.  As a member of the surgical strike team, you have to be ready to ferret out of this human waste and dispose of it appropriately. `Taken straight out of the Sega CD manual`[CR]</plot>

				<plot>DATELINE -- 1998In the post gulf war era, there's no safe harbor. Battles are no longer contained. There are no front lines. Enemy soldiers are trained terrorists who are securely settled in the middle of civilian populations. They are ready to strike at any instant.To penetrate this inner sanctum of evil, the UN created an elite team of special forces known as SURGICAL STRIKE. With the effectiveness of a mechanized marine battalion, each unit can boast 4 highly trained specialists (including the player) with advanced recon, weapons and vehicles (attack hovercraft) specifically designed for stealth, speed and firepower in any area.  As a member of the surgical strike team, you have to be ready to ferret out of this human waste and dispose of it appropriately. `Taken straight out of the Sega CD manual`[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>The Adventures Of Willy Beamish</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Willy Beamish is a point-and-click adventure game with several odd (especially at the time) game mechanics. It features the passage of time (certain events only take place at certain times of day) and Willy only has a certain amount of time to complete each "block" of time. It's a similar mechanic to that of Majora's Mask, albeit in a totally different genre. Secondly, the game features a "trouble meter" which indicates just how close Willy Beamish is to being sent to military school. If it fills up, the game is over.The game's universe is an odd mix of fantasy and reality, exemplified by one scene where Willy's babysitter turns out to be a practitioner of witchcraft. A puzzle-based boss battle ensues when she attempts to kill Willy and his sister.The game's cartoony look was accomplished by using hand-painted backgrounds and hand-animated sprites, like many adventure games of the era.Willy Beamish arguably pioneered the inclusion of everyday tasks in video games. Willy has to eat dinner and make conversation with his family, and at one point you have to disinfect and bandage your own finger after cutting it. It implements these tasks into the puzzle-solving elements of the game, and sometimes even make them integral to the plot.Willy Beamish's frog is named "Horny". [CR]Metagame[CR]Along with everyday mundane tasks, Willy can also head to his bedroom at most times to play the game-within-a-game: Monster Squad Super Space K'noidtrix for the Nintari game console. An interesting mix of Arkanoid and Tetris, puzzle-like pieces are thrown onto the playfield which must be avoided and destroyed before they stack up to the top of the screen. Several powerups can be shot and collected in the same manner as Arkanoid and can even be leveled up as rounds grow faster and harder. Combined with the peculiar soundtrack it makes for a decidedly Japanese feel in the middle of this Western-made game. [CR]System Requirements[CR]The original PC system requirements are:MS-DOS 5.0 or greater286 or better512 KB RAM8.5 MB Hard drive spaceVGAThunderboard Pro Aud Spectrum, AdLib, Roland MT-32/LAPC-1/CM-32L or SoundBlasterMouse[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Kingpin is at it again, and Spider-Man has just 24 hours to find the keys to defuse a bomb primed to wipe out New York City.  Worse, the Kingpin has convinced the citizens that Spider-Man is the bomb's mastermind, and they're now out for his radioactive spider blood.[CR]To clear Spider-Man's name, the player must guide him through multiple levels and familiar super-villains in search of the bomb's keys - all while the 24-hour time limit mercilessly counts down. At Spidey's disposal are a range of hand-to-hand combat moves, plus web tricks including stunning web shots, web swings, and a web shield.  Players can even form combos of web strikes and Spidey fists. And in a fairly uncommon platform maneuver, Spidey can stick to and crawl along any surface; including up walls and across ceilings.[CR]The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin for the Sega CD takes the idea and basic gameplay from the Genesis version, but makes some significant changes. There are new levels, new bosses, and an expanded set of combat moves. The player now has the freedom to select the next level or boss to tackle from a map screen. Graphics have also been redrawn and expanded from the Genesis release.  However, the player can no longer rest and heal at Peter Parker's apartment, or take photographs of enemies for cash; both prominent features of the Genesis version.[CR]Animated cutscenes with voices are new to this version, as well as a new CD soundtrack.  The player can also find and collect digital versions of classic Spider-Man comics, making further use of the multimedia storage space. A password system has also been added to save the player's progress.</plot>

				<title_clean>The Lawnmower Man</title_clean>
				<plot>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. [CR]With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.[CR]While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. [CR]The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</plot>

				<title_clean>The Masked Rider - Kamen Rider ZO</title_clean>
				<plot>The Masked Rider is a Japanese super hero, a man who has become genetically altered to be a man/grasshopper who rides a motorcycle. [CR]This FMV game adapts scenes from the movie Masked Rider ZO, and creates a Dragon's Lair style experience. The game centers around 10 battles of the film's 3 main characters.[CR]The player watches the video and hits the correct direction or button at the right time to achieve success. The visual cues of the movie suggest the correct buttons. For example, when the Masked Rider punches, the player should press the Punch button. If he dodges left on screen, the player should press the left direction pad.  Correct timing hits the enemy harder, lowering their health bar. Failure reduces the players health.[CR]Completing the moves accurately will allow the player to "defeat the monster early" and watch the rest of the video as a reward.</plot>

LeChuck attacks Guybrush and after lengthy exchange the two arrive at the ship emporium whereupon Guybrush sprays LeChuck with root beer, the cannibals ghost fighting elixir being made from voodoo root. With LeChuck demise Guybrush and Elaine share a romantic moment, watching fireworks.[CR]Development[CR]Developed by Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer, The Secret of Monkey Island began production shortly after Gilbert finished work on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The pirate premise of the game was inspired by Gilbert's love of The Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disneyland. His desire was to create a lush and fanciful world fill with swashbuckling pirates much like those seen in classic film and literature.The team's desire was to create a more accessible adventure game that anyone at any skill level could enjoy. Until then the genre had been known for being filled with difficult and often esoteric puzzles and full of trial and error gameplay. Gilbert and company hoped to avoid this by offering non linear puzzle sections such as The Three Trials where the player is free to work on a second puzzle if another becomes too difficult. The series also set the precedent in Lucasarts adventures of never allowing the player to die.Just before the game was set to ship, the company responsible for boxing the games and shipping to retailers told Lucasarts that they could not fill the order in time due to need to give their workers time off. This prompted nearly all of the Lucasarts staff to, themselves, box and ship all of the initial copies of The Secret of Monkey Island. Gilbert has said that during this time he, Grossman and Schafer each signed a one dollar bill and slipped it into one of the boxes. It's unknown if anyone ever found it.[CR]Insult Sword Fighting[CR]When sword fighting, it's not enough to have the right technique, you must also be able to parry an opponent's insults with appropriately witty responses. For example; the correct response to "You fight like a dairy farmer!" would be "How appropriate, you fight like a cow!". If the fighter responds with the correct come back, he earns the right to dish out the next insult. The first to three insults wins the fight.[CR]In-Jokes[CR]The Secret of Monkey Island is filled with references to Loom, another Lucasarts game released around the same time. Early in the game Guybrush encounters Cobb, a character from Loom who wears an "Ask me about Loom" button, who's only response to Guybush's attempts at conversation are "Aye". That is, however, until Guybrush asks him about Loom. Cobb then launches into full advertisement on the games excellent story and wonderful soundtrack. Other references to Loom include a seagull from them game and the line "I'm Bobbin, are you my mother?" after Guybrush is fired from a cannon.The game also takes a shot at fellow developer Sierra. At one point in the game the player can make Guybrush fall off a mountain resulting in a game over screen similar to those found in Sierra's adventure games that says "Oh, no! You've really screwed up this time! Guess you'll have to start over! Hope you saved the game!". After a few moments Guybrush flys back up the mountain and the game continues as normal.[CR]Easter Eggs[CR]When the ' Important Looking Pirates' in the Scumm Bar ask Guybrush if he has any special skills, one dialogue option is to tell them that he can hold his breath for 10 minutes. Later, when Fester Shinetop throws you into the water, if you wait 10 minutes you'll see Guybrush drown, bloat up, and a load is required.The Special Edition also includes a few references to past Lucas-Arts titles:In the cave where Le Chuck's vessel is anchored you'll see the face of Manny Calavera, the protogonist of Grim Fandango, hidden in one of the skull-filled speleothems.At the Giant Monkey Head there's an idol statue of The Purple Tentacle from Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle.[CR]The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition[CR]Special Edition Box ArtOn July 15, 2009, an updated "Special Edition" version of The Secret of Monkey Island was released on Xbox Live Arcade, PC, and iPhone/iPod touch (the game was later released on the PlayStation Network on April 22, 2010). This re-imagining has remained completely faithful to the original game, featuring updated 1080i graphics, new music, hand drawn recreations of all the characters, items, &amp; backgrounds, as well as full voice overs using the voice cast from The Curse of Monkey Island.The game has been given a streamlined interface designed to work better with a console controller. Players also have the ability to switch between the original version of the game and the special edition at any time with one button so that those who prefer the old style can still enjoy the experience. Moreover this version includes a built-in hint system for those who need it, which has three varying levels, but is a completely optional feature to use.[CR]PC System Requirements[CR]OriginalMS-DOS 5.0 or higher1 Mb of EMS required (2 Mb recommended)386/33 DX (486 DX recommended)Sounblaster and 100% compatibles, Adlib, Roland MT 32Special EditionWindows XP or VistaProcessor: Intel Pentium 4 3GHz or AMD Athlon 64 3000Memory: 256 MB RAM, 512 MB for VistaGraphics: 128 MB with Shader Model 2.0 capabilityDirectX: 9.0c (March 2009)Hard Drive: 2.5GB free hard drive spaceSound: DirectX 9.0c compliant sound card[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>The Terminator</title_clean>
				<plot>Similar to adaptations of The Terminator on other systems, the Sega CD game is a platformer where the player controls Kyle Reese, who travels back in time from the year 2029 to protect Sarah Connor from the unstoppable killing machine known as the Terminator.[CR]The game consists of 10 levels. Future locations include the post-apocalyptic wasteland of 2029 Los Angeles and the time displacement complex. In the present of 1984, Reese must traverse the streets and rooftops of L.A., as well as the Tech Noir club, the police station, and, for the finale, an automated factory. [CR]Reese is armed with a gun with unlimited ammo as well as a limited number of grenades to dispatch the many enemies, including Terminators and HKs in the future and punks in the present. In addition to these, several bosses must also be fought. The boss battles include several encounters with the Terminator, who naturally cannot be completely destroyed until the finale, but must be driven back to keep him from harming Sarah.[CR]Between levels, the game shows small digitized clips from the film that advance the storyline. The game also features a fully CD-based soundtrack with tracks ranging from heavy rock to electronic tunes.</plot>

				<title_clean>Third World War</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Third World War is a turn-based strategy game for the Sega CD where the player takes on the role as the leader of one of sixteen world powers, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, during the Cold War or four hypothetical scenarios. The game is won either through economic supremacy over 60 regions or by conquering 51 regions militarily without starting a nuclear world war.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is split between a turn-based mode similar to Risk and a real-time strategy mode for invasions.Each turn starts with a roundup of random events and actions taken by the computer over the past turn. The player is then given a limited amount of actions and resources to develop their economy and military, conduct diplomacy and covert actions, and initiate military strikes before advancing on to the next month.If the player chooses to invade a country during that phase or if one of the player's regions is invaded, the game switches to real-time mode as the player controlled army clashes with the computer controlled opponent until one side is destroyed or surrenders.[CR]Scenarios[CR]The Third World WarA post-Cold War world of 1995 with the US as the sole world power, Russia and China in decline, and the lesser world powers vying to fill this power vacuum.The Cold WarSet in 1985 during the final stages of the cold war, the US and Russia are the dominant world powers, but are both slowly declining due to bloating military overspending that's could give room to new challengers on the world stage.War of the Pacific PowersIn this scenario Japan has become a dominant world power stuck in the middle between a growing China and the United States.ChaosA scenario where the developed nations of the world are in an economic and military decline while Iraq, Libya, South Africa and India are filling the void by building their own empires.The Economic StruggleA scenario focusing on economic warfare and control with more weight put on foreign investment and economic prowess than raw military might.[CR]Playable nations[CR]Sixteen countries are are playable in the game, comprising a total of 40 of the 85 in the game.These are the United States of America, Russia, Japan, China, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, India, South Africa, Brazil, Australia, Canada, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Libya. Each nation starts with different advantages in military, economic, and diplomatic terms with some being more difficult to play as than others.Other nations, such as Italy, Cuba and Sweden, are non-playable and only exist as regions in the game.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Inspired by FMV laserdisc games such as Dragon's Lair and Ninja Hayate, Time Gal is a similarly structured arcade action-adventure filled with fully animated cutscenes and sequences. Players must lead Reika Kirishima through sixteen unique time periods and stop the evil Luda in his task to change history and gain power in his own time. As in Dragon's Lair, the player must think and react quickly to on-screen prompts in order to successfully guide Reika through each time period and face dangers such as dinosaurs in 70,000,000 BC and killer robots in the year 4000 AD.Time Gal features animation produced by Japanese studio Toei Animation, the studio responsible for numerous popular anime series and movies including the Dragon Ball franchise. The art and animation style is typical for mid to late 80's Japanese animation. The game was later ported to the Sega CD and saw a Western release in April of 1993. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>This is the first multimedia version of the classic Parker Brothers board game.  It uses photos, animations, videos &amp; voice clips to pose over 2000 questions and answers to Trivial Pursuit questions.[CR]In the Classic Game, up to 6 players roll an on-screen die and move their 'pie-dish' marker around the spoke-and-wheel game board, just like the board game.  The square you land on is color coded to one of six trivia categories:  People &amp; Places, Sports &amp; Leisure, History, Arts &amp; Entertainment, Science &amp; Nature, and Wild Card.  Answering the trivia question correctly lets you take another turn.[CR]Further, if you are on the 'prize' square at the end of each spoke (1 spoke end for each category color), the correct answer grants you a colored pie piece in your pie-dish marker for that category.  Once you have all 6 pie pieces in your dish, you need to head back to the hub for a final random question to win the game.[CR]In the Fast Game, up to 6 players can forgo the die-rolling and board movement.  It's a race to answer correctly a question from each category first!  Categories are randomly selected in this mode.</plot>

				<plot>Vay is the story of Prince Sandor of Lorath, and his quest to avenge the assassination of his parents and rescue his beloved Lady Elin. On what is to be the day of their wedding, Castle Lorath is assaulted by the Danek, who have been able to partially reconstruct alien mecha technology from a millennium ago. The castle defenses are powerless against the giant robots, and the king and queen are killed in the attack. The invaders steal Elin in the midst of her wedding vows. Prince Sandor, now the king of the realm, sets out to rescue his betrothed, and find a way to defeat the fearsome alien technology.[CR]The game is a thoroughly "old-school" Japanese-style RPG, meaning that the focus of the game is on fighting random enemies in turn-based combat, gaining experience and gold in process, without any additional gimmicks. The characters come with pre-set "classes" (wizard, bard, etc.), and learn their own abilities/magic spells automatically as they level up.</plot>

				<plot>An adventurer named Dusty returns home with an enchanted Totem Pole. Due to an assortment of rare events, the spirits of the Totem have been freed and they have created a bizarre parallel universe that can devour the world. Lowman, the "head" of the Totem, needs some "muscle" as he calls it, to bring them back. He finds a pencil on the desk and makes it come to life. The pencil tells Lowman to call him Woody, WILLLLLLLLD Woody. Lowman explains what has happened with his Totem brothers and now Woody goes into the parallel universe, dimension by dimension, and rounds up Lowman's Totem brothers.[CR]In this game, you destroy your enemies by jumping on top of them and Woody can also wipe them out with his eraser. You can erase certain walls to get through them and you can also erase boxes that most of the time teleport if you press down. Other boxes contain items. You also can sketch things and they will come to life, but you can only do this twice because Woody shrinks very quickly from doing this. There are also power-ups that make you grow again.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wing Commander is a single-player flight game that popularized the space flight simulator genre and paved the way for games such as the X-Wing/TIE Fighter series. A war rages between the Terran Confederation and the cat-like alien Kilrathi. The player is a rookie pilot on the Terran capital ship the TCS Tiger's Claw. Cinematic intros and a sythesized orchestral score provide a space opera feel.The single player campaign consists of a branching story arc that begins with the player in control of a lightly powered patrol craft. Continued success will lead to the unlocking of better equipped vessels. Failure will lead to missions with overwhelming odds, possibly resulting in the destruction of the Tiger's Claw and the end of the campaign. Campaign progress is broken up by adventure game style breaks in the pilot's lounge. The player can communicate with wingmates and fellow pilots using text-based menus and the dialogue will reflect previous mission results. If the wingmate dies on a mission, their chair/locker/barstool will be unoccupied and their name crossed off on the killboard.Missions are launched from the briefing room, with a series of checkpoints to visit and objectives to accomplish. Mission types offer some variety between patrols, escort duty, attack runs and investigations. Missions frequently change from their original description en route as the player encounters enemy Kilrathi and is forced to make snap decisions to maintain the mission.The game used 2D sprites rendered out at various angles to simulate a 3D entity in a similar way that Doom would use later to represent its computer controlled enemies. Even this simulated 3D experience taxed computer systems of the time to their limits; when played on the standard Amiga home computer, the framerate would often dip well into single digits when space battles got frantic.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wolfchild is a 2D shooter/platformer from British developers Core Design, which would later go on to create the Tomb Raider franchise. It features Saul Morrow, a man who is able to transform into a powerful werewolf form in order to fight the evil Chimera organization who kidnapped his scientist father Kal, from whom he received his powers. The game is a standard 2D platformer with shooting elements, and the player must collect energy before they can transform similar to Altered Beast.Wolfchild was originally released on the home computers Amiga and Atari ST, before being ported to various consoles like the Genesis, Master System, Mega-CD, SNES and Game Gear.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the score of 5 out of 10. He wrote, "...It's got great graphics, and some of the sound effects are dynamite, but Wolfchild loses big in the gameplay department. The punching and other attacks are awkward. This was a new idea, and the levels are huge, but the overall game is dull and rather unappealing".[CR]</plot>

The 1994 World Cup mascot, a brown soccer-playing dog named Striker, features heavily in the game's menus and box art. The game was released on almost every home computer and console active in 1994. This would be the last officially produced FIFA World Cup game, as World Cup tournaments would be folded into EA Sports's annualized FIFA Soccer games.The Super Nintendo version of World Cup USA 94 features all 24 qualifying teams for the 1994 World Cup and eight additional teams that did not qualify (including England, Scotland, France, Japan and other countries that traditionally buy a lot of soccer games). Non-qualifying teams are marked with an asterisk (*). Other versions had different assortments of non-qualifying teams, including Canada, Austria, Uruguay and the former nation of Czechoslovakia.USAGermanyMexicoGreeceRussiaColombiaBrazilBoliviaSwitzerlandItalyNorwayEngland*Republic of Ireland (Eire)Scotland*Denmark*BelgiumRomaniaSwedenFrance*MoroccoCameroonArgentinaJapan*South KoreaPortugal*Netherlands (Holland)SpainWales*NigeriaSaudi ArabiaAustralia*Bulgaria [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Space Ace</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Ace is Don Bluth's less-successful follow up to Dragon's Lair. Much of the same development team from Dragon's Lair worked on Space Ace, and the arcade cabinet utilized the same Laserdisc technology. For Space Ace, Bluth set out to push the Laserdisc technology beyond what he had previously showcased in Dragon's Lair, primarily by making greater use of its random-access abilities to create numerous branching pathways. Instead of building one linear sequence, and killing the player if they missed an action, the game could often incorporate a "miss" into its narrative and continue on.Just as was tried with the randomization of sequences in Dragon's Lair, the idea was that a player could have a different experience on the second, third, or even tenth play - in this case, checking out content they missed in the previous play. Space Ace was also designed to have a greater emphasis on story and characterization. To this point, unlike in Dragon's Lair, all the scenes happen in a specific order, with the occasional branching opportunities appearing within. This was done to address the "collection of disjointed scenes" criticism of Dragon's Lair.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Kimberly and Ace.The player controls the titular Space Ace on the trail of an evil alien mastermind named Borf. Borf has developed a new weapon, the "Infanto Ray", which he intends to use to enslave the population of Earth. While scouting Borf's space station, Ace's gal, Kimberly, is kidnapped and Ace himself is hit with the Infanto Ray. The ray transforms him into a lanky kid named Dexter, and leaves him in a state of fluctuating between these two forms.The player must fly, shoot, and dodge their way through Borf's lair, save Kimberly, reverse the effects of the Infanto Ray, and put a stop to Borf's plans for good.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is essentially identical to what was introduced in Dragon's Lair. The player has a joystick to select directions, and a "Shoot" button to perform actions. Animation plays up to a decision point, at which time the player has a second or less to react before the game will branch to a new path, or Ace will lose a life.Sections of the animation will quickly flash yellow to indicate both when and how the player should react. If a door on the left flashes, the player should flick the stick left to travel through the door. The action Ace will take after a successful move is often unpredictable, with the intention being that Ace's antics will surprise and entertain the player. If the player misses an action that results in death, they lose a life from their stock of 3 and must restart at the beginning of that section.Space Ace's main hook is its transforming protagonist. The player defaults to Dexter, whose cannot use a weapon, and whose sections are therefore based around dodging and avoiding hazards. Numerous times throughout the adventure, the player will get the option to "Energize". If they press the Shoot button in time, Dexter will transform into Ace, a muscular hero who can use his laser pistol to blast through enemies. Due to the branching pathway technology, if the player does not transform into Ace, they will often continue on an altered path as Dexter.Space Ace also introduced difficulty levels (Cadet, Captain, and Ace) whereas Dragon's Lair had only one. The difficulty levels were intended to make the game accessible to a wider audience, however, this was achieved by simply skipping over the more difficult sections. Nearly half the available scenes are playable on Cadet, and roughly 2/3rds on Captain, forcing players to master the Ace difficulty to see all the content.[CR]Presentation[CR]As with Dragon's Lair, hand-drawn cell animation was used running at 24 frames a second - the same as with an animated feature film. Colors were vibrant and detail unsurpassed by anything standard arcade hardware (or computers) could generate or display. A few of the sequences used models for rotoscoping, namely the spaceships, motorcycle, and tunnel and rocket skates scenes.Dragon's Lair's Chris Stone provided the soundtrack, this time more theatrical, continuous, and now recorded and presented in stereo. Space Ace features more dialogue than Dragon's Lair, so Bluth's studio did look for professional voice talent. In the end, to save money, they decided again to pull voices from within the studio. The sole professional voice talent is Michael Rye, reprising his role from Dragon's Lair as the game's narrator.Space Ace - Jeff Etter (animator)Dexter - Will Finn (animator/story)Kimberley - Lorna Pomeroy (animator)Borf - Don Bluth[CR]Versions[CR]Atari ST version.Initial ports were for home computers, and shipped on multiple floppy disks. The Laserdisc's cell animation was redrawn with less detail into computer sprites, and many levels reworked or redesigned to accommodate the hardware. Cutscenes were removed due to space limitations, so nearly all sequences cut sharply to the next, without transitions. Branching pathways are also removed, with some scenes altered and made more linear (for example, Dexter doesn't need to change to Ace to shoot the pistol).SNES versionThe SNES received the only console port of that generation, and replicated the arcade Laserdisc's vibrant colors with some success. However, gameplay is the most radically revised for this version - becoming essentially a platform title with new shooting sequences. Scenes are redesigned or invented for this version, with a focus on side-scrolling mechanics, and the player now controls Dexter/Ace fully at all times instead of making decisions at key points. Platform hopping and top-down shooting make up the basic gameplay here.Sega CD version.With the advent of CD-ROM based consoles, ports of the original Laserdisc game made the rounds with varying degrees of quality. The Sega CD release naturally featured the most compressed video, but the gameplay was largely intact. Modern releases, such as for iOS, use advanced video compression to the same effect. Digital Leisure also released a DVD version of the game, playable in most home DVD players by using the arrow keys on the remote. A similar Blu-Ray release of Space Ace and Dragon's Lair was completed in 2008.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Though Don Bluth set out to make a game that surpassed Dragon's Lair as a true showcase of animation, most arcade owners weren't impressed. Ace's increased difficulty level was cited as a problem, as was the decision to originally only offer Space Ace as a new cabinet (rather than a conversion kit). Space Ace also had the misfortune of hitting in the center of the 1983-84 video game crash, when consumer interest in the entire industry was noticeably suffering.Owners also seemed less interested in a different, but similar, game to the original Dragon's Lair as they were in an actual sequel for it. Bluth's studio would go on to put the advancements made in Ace to use in Dragon's Lair II.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Theatrical-style poster for Space Ace.Don Bluth decided to market Space Ace in a way that was new to arcade owners, but tried-and-true in the movie business - designing extensive press books and press kits to promote the game in the same way as a feature film. Theatrical movie posters were even printed up and distributed to arcade owners.The game often contradicts itself as to whether Dexter is a young Ace (and his real name), or a separate character. Kimberly occasionally calls Ace "Dexter", supporting the former, while the intro attract mode suggests Ace is trapped inside a kid's (Dexter's) body.[CR]System Requirements (Steam Release)[CR]PCMinimumOS: Windows XP SP3Processor: 1.8 GHz dual core CPUMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 256 MB GeForce 8800, Radeon 3850, or Intel HD 2000 GraphicsDirectX&#174;: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardRecommendedOS: Windows 7Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.2 GHz, or AMD Athlon 64 at 2.2 GHzMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 512 MB GeForce 220, Radeon 4550, Intel HD 3000 GraphicsDirectX&#174;: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardMacMinimumOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core Duo ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceRecommendedOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core i Series ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD space[CR]</plot>

				<plot>StarBlade was released in arcades in 1991, developed and published by Namco. The game featured a pod, which was developed by Panasonic, in which the user played inside which had become a growing trend in arcade games. However, the inside of the pod is what StarBlade became famous for. StarBlade used a concave mirror to reflect the image from the screen to the top of the pod. This feature was meant to give a deep space feel and StarBlade was the first video game to ever implement the idea. The pod also featured surround sound with four speakers. The game was played with a large 2-axis 4-button controller that acted as a laser gun. The controller's built in LED lights flashed every time an enemy was destroyed. In contrast, when the player was hit by enemies, the seat would rumble and flashes would temporary blind the player. StarBlade was later ported to the Sega CD and 3DO, obviously without the pod. These versions used full motion video backgrounds with polygonal overlays to approximate the arcade graphics. The Sega CD version features wireframe enemies as opposed to shaded enemies. Two years later, the game was also ported to the PlayStation under the name, StarBlade Alpha. The Playstation version features an additional campaign, hence the changed title.An emulated version of the arcade game is included in Tekken 5 on the Playstation 2 as the loading screen mini-game and as a bonus feature.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Star Wars - Rebel Assault</title_clean>
				<plot>Rebel Assault was a CD-ROM showcase title for Lucasarts, making use of full motion video in both cutscenes and gameplay sections. It is essentially an on-rails shooter in that the player's only means of interaction are pointing and shooting (either with a joystick or mouse), and the occasional branching path selection.  An arcade experience is clearly what was intended, as opposed to the more sim-like aspects of the X-Wing series. The CD-ROM format also meant that the game could make use of music and sounds from the Star Wars movies to a much larger degree.  The story is original, blending elements from Episode IV and Episode V.  The player character is named Rookie One.  Rookie One is somewhat analgous to Luke Skywalker, though the story is build around various set pieces from the films.  For example, the player Pilots a Snowspeeder on Hoth, helping defend the base against Imperial Walkers (a la Empire Strikes back) but the game ends with the Death Star confrontation from A New Hope.[CR]</plot>

The game is a standard chess game in which all of the pieces are represented by characters from the original Star Wars film trilogy. Similar to Battle Chess, when one piece captures another, a brief animation plays showing a battle between the two characters. Some of these battles could be particularly humorous, as it is possible for C-3PO (a light side bishop) to defeat Darth Vader (the dark side queen).[CR]Characters and Chess Pieces[CR]Light Side8 R2D2 Pawns2 C-3PO Bishops2 Yoda Rooks2 Chewbacca Knights1 Princess Leia Queen1 Luke Skywalker KingDark Side8 Imperial Stormtrooper Pawns2 Tusken Raider Bishops2 AT-ST Rooks2 Boba Fett Knights1 Darth Vader Queen1 Emperor Palpatine King [CR]</plot>

				<plot>DATELINE -- 1998In the post gulf war era, there's no safe harbor. Battles are no longer contained. There are no front lines. Enemy soldiers are trained terrorists who are securely settled in the middle of civilian populations. They are ready to strike at any instant.To penetrate this inner sanctum of evil, the UN created an elite team of special forces known as SURGICAL STRIKE. With the effectiveness of a mechanized marine battalion, each unit can boast 4 highly trained specialists (including the player) with advanced recon, weapons and vehicles (attack hovercraft) specifically designed for stealth, speed and firepower in any area.  As a member of the surgical strike team, you have to be ready to ferret out of this human waste and dispose of it appropriately. `Taken straight out of the Sega CD manual`[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Shining Force CD</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The story of Shining Force CD continues on from the end of the original  Shining Force on the  Sega Genesis. "A fierce battle with Dark Dragon ensued when the Runefaust Army invaded. The heroics of  Max and the Shining Force, Dark Dragon was defeated.The victors returned to their normal lives, vowing for renewed peace.Some disappeared, some left for further adventure,some returned to their homes and families and  Anri returned to her kingdom as the Queen of Gardiana. With help from  Ken,  Lug and  Lowe they rebuilt the kingdom from the ashes of the Runefaust invasion.The story begins 20 years after."After choosing a New Game, the player is asked to choose which book they wish to read from, either "Towards the Root of Evil" or "The Evil God Awakes". The books follow on from each other but there are completely separate teams for each book. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Towards the Root of EvilAnri is poisoned.Towards the Root of Evil starts in the throne room of Queen Anri where generals from the foreign land of Cypress attack her guards. Ken attempts to attack them but is ordered to stop by Anri. The lead general then presents a "gift" from the King of Cypress which ends up poisoning her.After the Gardiana army is presumed lost after being sent to attack Cypress, a group of youngsters come together to offer their services as a new Shining Force to recover a cure for Anri. Many of them are related to members of the original Shining Force, including Ken and  Hans' sons and  Gong's nephew. They are led by an outsider named Nick who came up with the plan.  Lowe also comes along as the Forces mentor, performing the same role as Sir Astral from  Shining Force 2. The Evil God Awakes  Sacrifice of the king.As the story starts, the player learns that the armies of Gardiana and Cypress have joined forces to stop the evil Iom. The game then cuts to a scene where Warderer sacrifices the king of Cypress to Iom. One of Warderer's generals, Barbara, informs him that the trap has been set for the Cypress army and it will be too late for the Gardiana army.Warderer then talks about needing the Sword of Hajya which is currently in the possession of Prince Nick of Cypress and concocts a plan to steal the sword from Cypress castle while the army marches on Iom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay consists of a series of battles interspersed with story elements. This differs from previous Shining Force games in that there is no overworld travel directly controlled by the player. In battle, the combat plays out like previous entries in the series, with each side moving its characters and then attacking with either physical or magical abilities. Once all of the enemies are defeated or in some cases, a more powerful boss enemy is destroyed, the battle ends and the story continues. Each member of the team handles very differently in battle depending on which class they are. This determines their stats, their abilities and which weapons they can wield.Once characters gain 100 experience through attacking and destroying enemies, they level up, increasing their stats. At level 10, players are able to visit the camp and have the character promoted a more powerful version of their starting class.When players visit towns between battles or when the Egress spell is used in battle, the game handles in a format similar to the town section in Shining in the Darkness, with the playable characters scrolling left to right and players being able to choose to enter locations such as the camp, to resurrect defeated team members, or to shop where new equipment can be purchased.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Silpheed</title_clean>
				<plot>The story contains some differences between the home computer versions and the later Sega CD version, making many consider the Sega CD game a sequel rather than a re-release, though the gameplay and many boss encounters are largely the same.In the home computer versions the primary antagonist is the named terrorist Xacalite, who has hijacked one Earth's finest battlecruisers, the Gloire, armed with planet buster weapons, and who over the course of the game actually blows up Earth.The Sega CD version instead tells the story of the first encounter with an unknown alien species, which upon meeting humans decide to attack (and, like in the PC version, end up destroying) Earth. The Sega CD's version of the story is also the premise for  the later games in the series, such as Silpheed: The Lost Planet for PS2 and Silpheed: Alternative AM for Android. The name of the player's ship is also different between the computer and console versions - it's name SA-08 Silpheed in the home computer version, and SA-77 Silpheed on the Sega CD.On the technical side, both the home computer and console versions of the game were very advanced for their time - the home computer version was an early showcase for real time polygonal graphics, as well as the Roland MT-32 sound card. The game and it's music on a tape were often bundled with the sound card.The Sega CD version does things slightly differently - the player's ship and the smaller enemies encountered in the game are still polygonal, but the detailed set-piece backgrounds are pre-rendered FMV, rendered in high resolutions, but low color and with a relatively low framerate in order for the console to be able to run it in full screen, the result is still a stunningly detailed, though stylized play field, where massive ships fight and blow up in the distance, and with a seamless transition between cutscenes and gameplay, with some relatively advanced camera movement that was unrivaled at the time of release, and for many years thereafter.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Sega CD version review scores of 9,7,7 and 7. Ed Semrad, who gave the highest score wrote, "...some of the most stunning visuals in a video game. The cinemas are unbelievable. The game itself is rather mundane. It is a simple shooter, that seems to lack real interaction with the amazing backgrounds. The fame play is solid, however, and there is absolutely no slowdown whatsoever. I only wish there could have been more interaction".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Snatcher is a cyberpunk adventure game, written and directed by Hideo Kojima. The player assumes the role of Gillian Seed, a new recruit to an elite police task force known as J.U.N.K.E.R. The player's goal is to investigate the emergence of the mysterious race known as the Snatchers, a race of cybernetic beings that kill humans and steal their appearance. The game takes place in the year 2046 on the artificial island of Neo Kobe 50 years after the explosion of a warhead destroyed large parts of eastern Europe in an event called the "Catastrophe." The game draws heavily from popular science fiction movies such as Blade Runner, Terminator, Akira and Aliens in both setting and character design as well as containing references to other Konami projects such as Metal Gear, Contra, Goemon and Castlevania. The game saw a remake which used a super-deformed art style with RPG style gameplay, known as SD Snatcher.Originally released for the NEC PC-8801 in Japan in 1988, the game has been remade several times for various platforms, such as the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The only English language translation was released for the SegaCD/MegaCD in Europe and America on December 15, 1994. The Sega CD version was the first to have light gun support, using Sega's Justifier light gun peripheral.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Shall I investigate Mika?Snatcher is a heavily text-based adventure, and most images are shown in a first person perspective, though there are a few cinematic shots. Throughout the game, the player is given a menu in order to interact with their environment. Most often, players have the 'Look' and 'Investigate' options available for interaction with the environment, and 'Use Metal Gear' and Inventory' options for other things. In special situations, players can speak with other characters, and show them items. At times, Gillian can also smell and search areas (or people). In most cases, the player must use choices more than once to get a complete picture of events and to move the story forward.There are special instances in the game where further interaction is available. First, there is one particular area that players can search with a flashlight. More commonly, the player must use their blaster to take down enemies. When the opportunity arises, players press a specified button to draw their weapon, and another button to fire. A grid is shown on the screen which the player navigates in order to take out enemies. Both of these sequences are not common occurrences. The game was originally meant to be played with a light gun for the shooting sequences.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Act 1: SnatchThis cyberpunk adventure begins as Gillian Seed begins his first day on the Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Ranger (J.U.N.K.E.R.) force, dedicated to protecting Humanity from murderous cybernetic criminals known as "Snatchers". We learn in the beginning that Gillian and his wife both have amnesia, and were discovered a few years prior. He and his wife, lacking memory of their relationship, are not seeing each other very often anymore. Gillian is shown around J.U.N.K.E.R. headquarters, where he meets Mika Slayton, the engineer Harry Benson, and the Chief Benson Cunningham. Gillian receives his blaster and his navigator, Metal Gear Mk.II. As soon as Gillian meets his partner, he receives a videophone call through Metal Gear from another J.U.N.K.E.R., Jean Jack Gibson. Jean Jack Gibson is in trouble, and needs help immediately. Gillian, though it is only his first day on the job, rushes off to complete his first task as a Junker. He rushes to the wreckage of an old building from which the call was made.Gillian with his blasterUpon arrival, the presence of an artificial pollen called Snow 9 is discovered, which is a sign of Snatcher presence. Gillian and Metal Gear go and explore the building, but all they find are the remains of Gibson's navigator, Little John, and Gibson's corpse. They discover that Gibson's head had been twisted off, something only a Snatcher would have the strength to do. They investigate to discover clues on both Gibson's corpse and Little John's memory bank. No Snatchers seem to be present, however, so the two move out to further investigate, hoping to identify the Snatcher that killed Gibson.Everyone at J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ is very hurt by the news that Jean Jack is dead, complicating the situation for Gillian. He consoles his comrades, and then moves forward in the investigation by searching Gibson's house. Gillian goes to Jean Jack's home, and speaks with his daughter, Katrina. While searching the home, he finds critical information regarding the identification of Snatchers. He learns that their artificial skin cannot cope with ultraviolet radiation, requiring them to operate at night, and use sunscreen at all times. As soon as he has this info, he moves out, hoping to utilize this to discover Gibson's murderer. Gillian also discovers an acquaintance of Jean Jack's, an informant codenamed "Napoleon". Napoleon provides information about Plato's Cavern and Outer Heaven, two places well known in the Neo-Kobe underground.Gillian's search leads him to a black market dealer and an underground restaurant, the only place in Neo Kobe that serves buffalo meat (which had been found in Gibson's stomach). He goes to this restaurant, Outer Heaven, and interrogates both the manager and one of the strippers. These interrogations give him a description of the man who must have killed Gibson, and Gillian and Metal Gear rush back to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ to use this description. The features described by the hooker at Outer Heaven lead Gillian to two suspects: Ivan Rodriguez and Freddy Nielsen. Gillian and Metal Gear first head to Rodriguez's apartment, located in a very rough area of town. When they get to his residence, Ivan comes out shooting. Gillian quickly disarms and interrogates him. Upon further investigation, evidence reveals that Ivan is not a Snatcher. All is not in vain, however, as Ivan is in possession of an illegal drug, explaining his actions, and he is later arrested by civilian police. Gillian now goes to find the other suspect, Freddy Nielsen.Gillian arrives at the Nielsen home only to discover Freddy isn't around. After questioning Nielsen's wife and searching for concrete evidence of Freddy's state, Gillian is attacked by his wife, who is a Snatcher. After killing her, Gillian and Metal Gear leave the scene, but as they do, a light comes on. They go back to figure out what happened, only to be attacked by Freddy Nielsen. Nielsen has Gillian by the neck, and Gillian seems helpless. Just before all hope is lost, a civilian bounty hunter, Random Hajile, saves Gillian.Act 2: CureGillian's first move in Act 2 is to find any information he can about the Snatchers' illicit hospital where they treat their skin. First, by searching the memory banks of Little John, an image of a neon sign that says 'Hospital Oleen' is discovered. For further information, Gillian seeks out Napoleon. Napoleon knows of an Oleen hospital, and provides Gillian with information on it for the right price. Gillian and Metal Gear rush to Oleen hospital, only to discover it is a veterinary clinic. Without bothering to investigate inside, they assume that the neon sign in the image from Little John must have been broken, and they need to find more clues.Benson's officeOnce the two finish speaking to Napoleon, they receive an urgent call concerning Katina Gibson. She had called in a panic earlier, requesting Gillian's help. Gillian immediately travels to her home, to find it torn apart. Gillian observes the scene, and finds evidence that it is a Snatcher's doing. When Gillian is just about to leave to find Katrina, Alice, the Gibsons' dog, is thrown through the window in a bloody mess. Hoping to find Katrina in one piece, Gillian and Metal Gear search for any place they may find her. When their search yields no results, they return to Gillian's apartment. Once the pair arrives at the apartment, they discover someone has been there.They enter cautiously and find that someone is using the bathroom. Slowly, they enter, and open the shower only to find Katrina, who quickly sprays Gillian in fright. Once she is decent, it is time for an explanation. Gillian questions Katrina, and she tells him why she came to his house, and what the Snatchers were doing in her home; She had found more clues. All three of them then attempt to figure out what was missing from Little John's image. They conclude that the Snatcher hospital is not "Oleen", rather, it is Queen's Hospital. With this newfound information, Gillian and Metal Gear head for their next destination.Upon arriving at Queen's Hospital, our heroes find a dark, abandoned building. It seems no one has been there for ages. The continue their investigation to find some interesting things in one of the rooms. They find a map of Russia, which is consistent with the Snatchers' strange obsession with Russia, and one piece of patient data left behind. The patient record is written in a complex form of Chinese, so the two need help to decode it. Once again, Gillian seeks the help of Napoleon.Gillian and Metal Gear find Napoleon at Outer Heaven. Luckily, Napoleon, a purebred Chinese man, knows the symbols on the patient record. It is a puzzle involving the periodic table. The group decodes the message, discovering the patient's name is 'Benson.' Shocked, Gillian rushes off to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ; there are only two Bensons he knows of. Unfortunately, neither the Chief nor Harry are at HQ. Gillian thoroughly searches the building for any clue, and finds a message from Harry. "Face to Face" is all that he left for them. Gillian further searches, realizing what this clue means. It refers to a painting in the Chief's office, an optical illusion, which shows both a vase and two faces. Gillian investigates, and discovers an image of Red Square in Moscow behind the painting. Believing that the Chief is probably a Snatcher, they leave to try and track him down. As they are leaving, they receive a videophone call from Gillian's wife, Jamie Seed. She has somehow discovered that Queen's Hospital installed a basement. This must be where they are operating from! Gillian and Metal Gear rush back to the hospital.All does not go as planned, however. As soon as they begin driving the turbocycle, they discover it has been sabotaged. Gillian constantly struggles to find a way to stop the vehicle, but to no avail. Once again, Random Hajile comes to the rescue just before Gillian meets his end. Random joins the two, and they head to the hospital.Once they arrive, they immediately search for and find the secret basement. They search all around, and eventually come across the Snatchers' morgue, containing four Human corpses. Metal Gear analyzes the bodies, to identify them and find out if the Snatchers had assumed their identities. The first two bodies are the Nielsens, the second is Chin Shu Oh, who once ran the hospital... and the third to Chief Benson Cunningham. With this new discovery, the three attempt to leave, only to encounter Chin Shu Oh and other Snatchers. All hope seems lost, but Random has one last trick up his sleeve. He tells Gillian to escape through a nearby ventilation shaft, and he uses explosives attached to himself to take down the building in a suicide attack.After the explosion, Gillian and Metal Gear find themselves in a long shaft, and observe that it was likely used by Snatchers to travel. They go further down to find it connects to an abandoned subway rail, which the Snatchers must have used to get around. They walk through the Snatcher Underground Railroad, looking for an exit. They eventually come across a ladder, which appears to take them out. They use this ladder, only to end up in the Nielsens home. They conclude this must have been how Freddy Nielsen entered the home without being noticed to attack Gillian. They had to get back to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ immediately, and leave.NapoleonTo get back to HQ, Gillian calls up a taxi. When Gillian requests he be taken to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ, the driver acts strangely. It turns out that the driver is actually Chin Shu Oh, and Gillian takes him out. Once that is over, they rush off to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ in the comandeered taxi.When Gillian arrives, he finds that someone has attacked HQ. Mika has been locked into her pod, and Metal Gear attempts to open it. Once open, they find Mika unconscious. They revive her, and she tells them that Harry ran in after Chief Cunningham, and locked the door behind. She allows them to go inside, and they dash inside to help Harry. Gillian and Metal Gear find Harry laying in a pool of his own blood. Harry tells them how he discovered that the Chief was a Snatcher, but was no match for the murderous robot. Harry then dies in Gillian's arms. Enraged, Gillian is determined to get revenge for Harry's death. Once again, he searches HQ. Gillian finds the Chief clinging to the ceiling of his office, and kills him.Act 3: JunkAct 3 begins with Gillian, Metal Gear, and Mika going over all that has happened up to that point. They discuss the Snatchers' weaknesses, those who have been discovered to be Snatchers, and the mysterious information that has been gathered. Upon studying all they know, they notice some actual links between the Snatchers and Russia, the country they're so obsessed with. It seems the Snatchers all consider this place their home.At this time, Metal Gear reveals that he actually knows all about Gillian and his mysterious past. Gillian and his wife Jamie were found cryogenically frozen in a Russian facility near the spot where the Catastrophe, a nuclear attack that devastated all of Europe, had occurred. There was one other pod, but it was empty. Jamie and Gillian both had amnesia as a result of the cryogenic suspension, and knew nothing. After inexplicably moving to Japan, Gillian joined the J.U.N.K.E.R. squad hoping it would help him recover their lost memories. Gillian also discovers that Harry Benson was he and Jamie's fully grown son.Shocking revelationsThe three decide to find the place that the Snatchers are gathered in Neo-Kobe. The conclude it must be in an area near a river from which Snow 9 originates, and a place easily accessible through the subway tunnels. All signs point to the Snatchers hiding in an old abandoned chapel, which somehow seems to line up with the Moscow river. Gillian, deciding this must be the secret hideout of the Snatchers, rushes to the scene.Unfortunately for the J.U.N.K.E.R.s, time is short. The Kyoto Summit discussing the Snatcher problem is getting together, and in approximately three hours, all authority J.U.N.K.E.R. has will be dissolved. They would also vote whether or not to completely destroy Neo-Kobe with nuclear weapons to end the Snatcher threat once and for all. Gillian must work quickly.Once Gillian and Metal Gear arrive, they find the church empty. The enter, and see a portrait of a man called "Modnar," who is clearly Random Hajile. They go further in, and find the snatchers being prepared to act as humans. They find data planning to snatch and replace many major world leaders and Gillian himself. With little time left, Metal Gear psychotically reveals that if ordered to by Kyoto, he will murder Gillian. Gillian asks Metal Gear to go out and attempt to convince the delegates in Kyoto to give him more time. Metal Gear agrees, and leaves Gillian to continue by himself.Gillian moves on, and encounters numerous Snatchers. He kills them and moves into the final chamber, where he finds Jamie, who explains how she was captured and taken to work on the development of a perfect artificial skin for the Snatchers with Dr. Modnar. Dr. Modnar was well past 100 years of age, however, and had passed on minutes before Gillian's arrival. Jamie cries about how she did it because they threatened to take their son's life, and Gillian tells her how their son, Harry, was already murdered by the Snatchers.Taking out a SnatcherAnother man reveals himself at this point. An old man in a wheelchair, Dr. Elijah Modnar. He had captured is father, the elder Dr. Modnar, to perfect his snatchers. He describes to Jamie and Gillian how he was recruited long ago to work on this project with them to simulate humans. The Snatchers were intended as a means of taking power over all other nations, the ultimate weapon. He worked on the team with Jamie, and fell in love with her. At one point in time, his only motivation to work was his love for her. Later, Gillian was hired to work with the psychological properties of the Snatchers. Jamie and Gillian fell in love and were married. Elijah was furious at this, and plotted to end it all. He set off the massive weapon Lucifer Alpha, creating the Catastrophe, and had Gillian and Jamie join him in cryogenic freezing. His plan was to leave Gillian frozen, and awaken Jamie so they could live together in peace. When he final woke up, however, he could not bring himself to do it. Instead he worked day after day, observing her silent, peaceful state. He had also realized that there would be no way he could convince her to carry on working after she realized that he'd killed billions of people because he was jealous of her love, so he left her and Gillian in suspension. Eventually, he fled, and Gillian and Jamie's bodies stayed in stasis for many years, so long that amnesia was a side effect, before they were discovered, setting the events of the game in motion.Elijah continued working on the snatchers, but could never perfect the skin. He knew his father could finish the job, so he sought his help. However, his father refused. This was no problem, as Elijah Modnar had discovered a "kinetic being" like a Snatcher, created by his father. He reveals that Random Hajile was this perfect robotic being, and by taking a sample of his skin, Elijah Modnar could perfect his snatchers and carry out his plans.The combat gridMetal Gear, strapped with explosives, appears at the scene. The delegates in Kyoto had agreed not to take action if this chapel was destroyed. In ten minutes, a blast would be sent destroying the chapel, which would qualify as Kyoto taking action. Multiple Snatchers appear to stop Jamie and Gillian's escape. Once more, Random Hajile comes to the rescue, though he was thought dead. He takes Elijah Modnar by the neck, and demands that the Snatchers stand down and let Jamie and Gillian escape. They agree, and the two escape just in time, right as the church is obliterated.The closing scene of Snatcher has Gillian and Jamie discussing their plans for the future. Gillian is preparing to take a short trip to Russia to try and regain his memory. He and Jamie plan to live together once again. Mika and Katrina come to wave him off and congratulate him on his successful mission. Mika reveals that the J.U.N.K.E.R. squad will remain intact, with a new Chief. As Gillian is about to leave, a newly fashioned Metal Gear arrives. Random dived upon him, saving him from the blast.[CR]Version Differences[CR]The first release of Snatcher was in 1988 for the NEC PC-8801 and MSX2, both on floppy disks. In order for consistent sound, the MSX2 version included an audio cartridge. Both versions ended at Act 2. The PC Engine version added the 3rd Act in addition to improving graphics and sound thanks to the CD-ROM's expanded capabilities.The Sega CD was the first iteration to support any type of light gun, utilizing Sega's Justifier.Only acceptable if this girl is 18 years or older.Some of the main changes in the English localized version of Snatcher were the result of different censorship policies in each country. The American version saw Katrina's age changed from 14 to 18, due to a shower scene and Gillian's treatment of her. At one point in Japanese version, a bare breast was shown, and it was covered up in the English version. Certain animations were also cut, such as the twitching of decapitated corpses in the game. The English version also saw customers at Outer Heaven dressed as Konami characters, while the Japanese title had the guests dressed as sci-fi characters, a change made to avoid legal problems in the west. Another change to avoid legal problems was the appearance of the Snatchers themselves, who got an overhaul in appearance to tone down their originally deliberate resemblance to the Terminator. Gillian's eye colour is changed from brown to blue in the English SEGA CD version, most likely for aesthetic purposes.Another great change was to Act 3, which was originally very uninteractive. While it still has much less player interaction then the other chapters, player interaction was added to involve the player in the final chapter of the game. The ending was improved and expanded, and a longer intro scene was added.The murder of Alice the dog in the Japan-only PS1 release of Snatcher was changed to a more decent depiction when compared to the Sega CD version; while the Sega CD shows Alice's corpse from the front, her intestines leaking from her torso, the PS1 version shows her from behind, only showing a pool of blood.[CR]Connections to Other Games[CR]Snatcher is filled with references to other Konami titles.In the Japanese version of the game, the guests inside Outer Heaven were dressed as characters from famous science fiction franchises, but these were changed to Konami characters in the English release, including Goemon from The Legend of the Mystical Ninja, Simon Belmont and Dracula from Castlevania, and Lance and Bill from Contra.The script was translated into English by Jerry Blaustein, who later translated Metal Gear Solid.The game's manual (English Sega CD) was done by Kevin O'Donohue, who did the manual for Metal Gear.There's a Moai Head mask in Napoleon's shop in reference to Konami's Gradius series shmup.The restaurant which Gillian visits for information multiple times is named Outer Heaven, the name of Big Boss's haven in the Metal Gear seriesGillian's navigator is Metal Gear Mk.II, inspired by the bipedal tanks which lend their namesake to the Metal Gear games. A non-sentient robot tool appears in Metal Gear Solid 4 as one of Solid Snake's pieces of equipment, also known as Metal Gear mk. II.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack to Snatcher was first composed by Kukeiha Club, Konami's in-house sound production team and published by King Records in 1989. It contains the MIDI sequenced soundtrack found on the MSX and PC-8801 versions of the game and features English narration throughout the album. The soundtrack for the Sega CD version was arranged by Kazuo Hashi and Yuzo Hayashi and features a more vibrant sound due to the Sega CD's cutting edge 32khz audio chip. It was released in 1992 as The Cyber Punk Adventure Snatcher -Zoom Tracks- and is the version most players will be familiar with.SnatcherSnatcherTotal length: 49:54AD 2042 Neo Kobe CityBio HazardTwilight of Neo Kobe CityEvil RippleTheme of SnatcherCreeping Silence ~Criminal Omen~ Danger Dance... &amp; Justice AllInnocent GirlTheme of JaimeDecadence BeatThe Entrance To Hell ~ Theme of IzabelTheme of KatherineTheme of JunkerBlow Up TricycleSpreading Diehard ~ Eternal Promise (Goodbye Randam)Faded MemoriesRestoration ~ Pleasure of Tention ~ Endless PursuerBeyond SorrowsMaster of Puppets Among The DiseaseTheme of EndingSnatcher: The Syber Punk Adventure -Zoom Tracks-The Syber[sic] Punk Adventure Snatcher -Zoom Tracks-Total length: 44:32Bio HazardOne Night In Neo Kobe CityTwilight of Neo Kobe CityTheme of SNATCHER (Part 1)Theme of SNATCHER (Part 2)Theme of JamiePleasure of TensionFaded MemoriesEternal Promise (Good-Bye Randam)Beyond SorrowsTear-stained Eyes [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sonic the Hedgehog, about to go fast.Sonic CD (known in Japan as "Sonic the Hedgehog CD") is a 2D action platformer developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega CD on September 23, 1993 (in Japan), October 1993 (in Europe), and November 19, 1993 (in North America).Along with the traditional gameplay of early Sonic the Hedgehog games, Sonic CD features the concept of time travel, allowing Sonic to alter the course of a given level's history by traveling through time and making changes to the past. The game also includes redbook audio (with separate soundtracks for the Japan/PAL and North American releases), a Time Attack mode, and animated FMV introduction and ending movies produced by Toei Animation.Sonic's adventure revolves around "Little Planet", a miniature planet which is believed to contain unique time shifting properties. After his nemesis, Dr. Robotnik, tethered the planet to a mountain over a giant lake and began conquering its past using its weak temporal boundaries, Sonic must traverse the planet and free it from Dr. Robotnik's control while rescuing his captured love interest, the pink hedgehog Amy Rose, from his robotic rival Metal Sonic.Sonic CD was later ported to the PC (on computers using Windows 95) in 1996 (later re-released by Expert Software) and was included in the Sonic Gems Collection compilation for the PlayStation 2 (outside North America) and GameCube in 2005.Tails in the downloadable 2011-2012 version of Sonic CD.An enhanced port, developed by independent game developer Christian "Taxman" Whitehead, was released for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade on December 14, 2011), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network on December 20, 2011), Android devices (on December 14, 2011), iOS devices (on December 15, 2011), PC (via Steam on January 19, 2012), Windows Phone devices (on November 9, 2012), and Ouya (on August 1, 2013). The game engine used for the port was re-developed from scratch, maintaining the original feel while adding widescreen display support, optional Spin Dash controls from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (in which the player gains speed by tapping the jump button repeatedly), the option to choose between the Japanese/PAL and North American soundtracks, and the inclusion of Miles "Tails" Prower as a secret playable character. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The core gameplay of Sonic CD is very similar to other Sonic the Hedgehog games at the time. The premise is to traverse a series of obstacles and enemy robots (while collecting golden rings and power-ups) to reach each stage's goal. Unlike other platformers, Sonic's speed gives him the momentum to traverse through these environments at a fast pace, though most levels are built in a way to limit that to promote exploration, and even the time travel mechanic is often used as an obstacle to hinder the player.Sonic using his Super Peel-Out technique to enter a loop at a very fast speed.The player moves Sonic left and right using the directional pad and jumps using any Jump button. Holding up on the d-pad lets Sonic look up (temporarily shifting the screen upwards) while holding down on the d-pad lets Sonic crouch (temporarily shifting the screen downwards if held down long enough) Crouching while moving causes him to curl up into a ball (known as the Super Spin Attack), reducing his friction against the ground while allowing him to destroy most enemies (whereas running into them will damage Sonic instead). Jumping also curls him up into a ball, allowing him to destroy most enemies whenever airborne. The Jump button can also be used in certain levels for interacting with objects (such as the pinball flippers in Collision Chaos Zone).Sonic has two techniques that allow him to instantly gain momentum from a fixed position. The first, returning somewhat from Sonic the Hedgehog 2, is the Spin Dash (known in Sonic CD as the Super Spin Dash), which is performed by holding down on the d-pad and pressing the Jump button. After releasing the d-pad, Sonic moves forward (in a speed determined by how long the d-pad was held) while doing his Super Spin Attack. The second technique is the Super Peel-Out, which is performed by holding up on the d-pad and pressing the Jump button. The Super Peel-Out is the same as the Super Spin Dash, except that it propels Sonic faster at the cost of his Super Spin Attack (causing him to be vulnerable to enemies).Hitting most enemies while not performing one of the Spin Attacks (or hitting certain enemies and hazards regardless) causes Sonic to do both of two things: Lose all of his possessed rings (but allow him to re-collect some of the rings that fell out of him this way) and stun him momentarily, or (if he does not have any rings in his possession) lose a life and begin again from a checkpoint. However, the player immediately loses a life every time he is crushed between moving objects, falls down the bottom of the level (which is rare in Sonic CD), drowned underwater (spending a lot of time underwater without touching large air bubbles), and spends more than ten minutes in the current life on the current stage. If Sonic loses all of his lives, it's Game Over. Sonic begins the game with three lives, and can earn lives by either collecting 1-Up power-ups, collecting 100 rings, or earning 50,000 points.As a hidden easter egg, an instant Game Over can occur if the player leaves Sonic idle (and unpaused) for more than three minutes at one time (in which Sonic says "I'm outta here!" and leaps off the screen). Time TravelDestroy these robot teleporters to save the future!Sonic CD is the only game in the original series to include the concept of time travel as an in-game mechanic. By passing a signpost marked "PAST" or "FUTURE", Sonic would be charged with mysterious energy. The ''PAST'' or ''FUTURE'' symbol at this point appears on the bottom of the screen. While in possession of this signpost, if Sonic could maintain a high-level speed for several seconds (which is difficult to accomplish intentionally, as losing that momentum at any point for the last few seconds after attaining would cause Sonic to lose the energy and the sign), he would be whisked off to a different time era, featuring a permutated version of the same level. The level may include new obstacles, enemies, and puzzles. There are four permutations for each stage:Present - The default era for the first two stages of each Zone. Includes both "PAST" and "FUTURE" signposts and non-functioning "robot teleporters".Past - A primitive-looking version of the stage. Includes only "FUTURE" signposts, functioning "robot teleporters" (which can be destroyed, saving the future of that stage and causing all enemies in the Past to disappear), and functioning holograms of Metal Sonic tormenting animals (which can also be destroyed).Bad Future - A ruined dystopia (which Dr. Robotnik rules) that is the default era for the third stage of each Zone (assuming the player did not destroy the "robot teleporter" in each of the two preceding stages). Bad Future can be accessed in other stages if the player travels to the future and did not destroy the "robot teleporter" in the past. Includes only "PAST" signposts.Good Future - A shining utopia with minimal enemies and obstacles. The default era for the third stage of each Zone (if the player destroyed both "robot teleporters" in the preceding stages). Can be accessed in other stages if the player travels to the future and did destroy the "robot teleporter" in the past. Includes only "PAST" signposts.If either all fourteen "robot teleporters" are destroyed or the player collecting all seven Time Stones in the special stages, then the player receives a "good ending" at the end of the game. Otherwise, the player receives a "bad ending". Destroying all fourteen holograms of Metal Sonic shows a hidden congratulation at the end of the game. Special StagesSonic running towards a UFO in a special stage.If Sonic crosses a goalpost with 50 rings held, the player can choose to play a special stage by letting Sonic jump into a giant golden ring close to the goalpost. Special stages are three-dimensional Mode 7 courses in which Sonic (shown in third-person perspective) must run around and collide with six flying UFOs (usually by jumping) in a limited amount of time while avoiding time-consuming obstacles.Each of the six UFOs, when destroyed, grant Sonic either a group of coins (for scoring purposes) or a Power Sneaker powerup, allowing Sonic to run faster through the course for a short period of time. If the time dwindles down to 20 seconds, a blue UFO appears near the center of the course which, if destroyed, grants Sonic 30 extra seconds.Each of the seven courses are filled with different terrain that either help or hinder Sonic's progress. Grass and rough patches of gravel, for example, slow down Sonic. Water not only slows Sonic down, but increases the rate at which the timer goes down (as well as take away 10 seconds on each landing on the water). Fans slowly propel Sonic upwards (allowing him to take out UFOs easier) while springs quickly propel Sonic upwards (allowing him to reach a farther distance quicker). Spiked pits cause Sonic to fall to the ground and lose some rings. ZonesDoing good in Tidal Tempest.Palmtree Panic ZoneCollision Chaos ZoneTidal Tempest ZoneQuartz Quadrant ZoneWacky Workbench ZoneStardust Speedway ZoneMetallic Madness ZoneWhile the final game has seven stages, data from the PC version's CD-ROM disc reveals that there was an eighth stage in development (between Palmtree Panic and Collision Chaos). Clues regarding what this stage could have been is hidden in the game (from the "Little Planet" artwork on loading screens featuring a cactus-filled desert region, to a clip in the credits video featuring dilapidated ruins). The 2011 remake, developed by Christian "Taxman" Whitehead, was originally going to include a bonus level based on the concept (titled "Desert Dazzle") and a new final stage (titled "Final Frenzy", which was only accessible by collecting all seven Time Stones and allowed Sonic to travel through time without needing signposts), but both were redacted by Sega. [CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The cover for the North American soundtrack, titled after the game's main American theme.Sonic CD was the first Sonic game to feature full CD-quality redbook audio, and two versions of the soundtrack exist: the original Japanese soundtrack (composed by Naofumi Hataya and Masafumi Ogata), and the American soundtrack (composed by Spencer Nilsen, David Young, and Mark Crew).Every stage in the game has four themes: Original, Past Mix, Good Future Mix, and Bad Future Mix, each played on each of the four permutations of the stage. While the Original, Good Future Mix, and Bad Future Mix are redbook and different for each soundtrack, the Past Mix uses the Sega Genesis's PCM synth audio, which is the same for all soundtracks (and is based on the Japanese soundtrack).The main themes for the Japanese soundtrack, also used in the European version of the game, are "Cosmic Eternity - Believe in Yourself" by Naofumi Hataya and "Sonic - You Can Do Anything" by Masafumi Ogata. Both features lyrics by Casey Rankin and vocals by Keiko Utoku. The primer one is used at the game's introduction sequence and the latter one is used at the game's ending sequence. The 2011 enhanced port uses an instrumental version of these themes.The main theme for the American soundtrack is "Sonic Boom" by Spencer Nilsen, featuring vocals by Pastiche. Used in the game's introduction, ending, and title sequences, the track would later be included in the soundtrack for Super Smash Bros. Brawl (as one of the themes for Sonic the Hedgehog's stage). [CR]Development History[CR]After the completion of Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991, Yuji Naka was not happy. His parent company, Sega of Japan, paid its employees based on their seniority - those who worked at the company longer got paid more than the new recruits, and in the grand scheme of things Naka was still considered fairly new, despite having been a key figure in launching one of Sega's biggest franchises. He quit his job at Sega of Japan - but not before being lured to Sega of America by Mark Cerny. Mark Cerny was part of the " Sega Technical Institute", a program/development team whose ultimate goal was to bring overseas developers in to impart their wisdom to the relatively inexperienced American designers. With Naka came a number of other key Sonic Team staff, and it was here at Sega Technical Institute that groundwork was laid for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 - a game that was to be much larger in scope than the original Sonic, with nearly three times as many levels, two playable characters, split-screen multiplayer, and a time travel mechanic.Back on the other side of the globe, the original character designer for Sonic and Dr. Eggman, Naoto Ohshima, was offered the opportunity to make his own Sonic 2 at Sega of Japan for their up-and-coming hardware add-on, the Sega CD. Given that the majority of Sonic Team was in America working on Sonic 2, Ohshima had to assemble his own team out of Sega of Japan's roster of designers, lending the game a unique flavor separate from the Sega Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog games. Ohshima and his Japan team took the concept of time travel and ran with it, developing a gameplay mechanic around traveling back in to the past in order to alter the status of the future.Sonic CD concept art for "Metal Sonic"Whereas Sonic 2 introduced Tails, Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose and Metal Sonic, brought to life by Kazuyuki Hoshino; his first job in what would become a long lasting relationship with Sonic Team. Though the game originally started life as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega CD, the two projects had diverged so dramatically in style and mechanics (especially after Sonic 2 saw cuts that nixed its time travel concept) that the game was eventually renamed simply "Sonic CD". The game was originally intended to launch shortly after the original Sonic the Hedgehog, but Sega felt it was more important to release Sonic the Hedgehog 2 first, delaying the fully-completed Sonic CD almost a full year beyond its originally intended launch date, instead using the game to fill the gap between Sonic 2 and Sonic 3. [CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Whitehead's "Desert Dazzle" concept art.Putting a Sonic CD disc in to a PC CD-ROM drive reveals at least one level was cut from the game's level roster. The data for each level in the game is organized by numbered folders, starting at "r1" up to "r8". However, the "r2" folder is missing, jumping from "r1" directly to "r3". Clues regarding what this stage may have looked like are hidden all over the game; the "Little Planet" artwork used on some loading screens features a cactus-filled desert region that is never actually seen in-game, and the extended version of the credits video showcases Sonic leaping through dilapidated ruins before confronting a giant Ant-lion robot, similar in appearance to the first boss of Sonic 2 for the Sega Game Gear. In Christian Whitehead's 2011 remake of Sonic CD, he was originally going to include a level based on this lost "r2" concept named "Desert Dazzle", but Sonic Team felt it would be better if the game stayed true to the original Sega CD release.Upon entering the game's "Debug Mode" Cheat Code, you see artwork of Miles "Tails" Prower standing next to a jeep with the text, "See you next game - Judy Totoya". Judy Totoya was a pen name sometimes used by Yasushi Yamaguchi, original character designer for Tails. "See you next game" is in reference to the game's original, "before Sonic 2" release date. In Christian Whitehead's Sonic CD update, this "See you next game" artwork is displayed when the player unlocks the ability to play as Tails.In an effort to tie Sonic CD to the upcoming wave of Sonic the Hedgehog comic books and TV shows, Sega of America renamed Amy Rose in the original English Sonic CD game manual to "Princess Sally". This was later retconned by the aforementioned Archie comic books, who restored her name back to Amy Rose.The character of Amy Rose is most likely derived from the Japanese Shogaku Yonensei Sonic the Hedgehog Manga. It featured a mild-mannered hedgehog named Nicky who would turn in to the super hero "Sonic" when his friends were in danger. Nicky's girlfriend was named Amy.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Vay is the story of Prince Sandor of Lorath, and his quest to avenge the assassination of his parents and rescue his beloved Lady Elin. On what is to be the day of their wedding, Castle Lorath is assaulted by the Danek, who have been able to partially reconstruct alien mecha technology from a millennium ago. The castle defenses are powerless against the giant robots, and the king and queen are killed in the attack. The invaders steal Elin in the midst of her wedding vows. Prince Sandor, now the king of the realm, sets out to rescue his betrothed, and find a way to defeat the fearsome alien technology.[CR]The game is a thoroughly "old-school" Japanese-style RPG, meaning that the focus of the game is on fighting random enemies in turn-based combat, gaining experience and gold in process, without any additional gimmicks. The characters come with pre-set "classes" (wizard, bard, etc.), and learn their own abilities/magic spells automatically as they level up.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]WWF Rage in the Cage is an updated port of the SNES and Genesis title WWF Royal Rumble. It added steel cage matches (naturally) and FMV sequences (the first console pro wrestling game to include them). Howard Finkel does voiceover ring introductions for the participants, and audio of the wrestlers giving short promos is heard before the match begins.Somewhat strangely, the game does not include CD-quality music used for the wrestler entrance themes, it contains the same songs produced by the system's built-in audio capabilities used in the Genesis WWF games of the time.[CR]Roster[CR]Bam Bam BigelowBig BossmanBret HartCrushFatuSamuCurt HenningIRSKamalaLex LugerBrian KnobbsJerry SagsRazor RamonRandy SavageRick MartelShawn MichaelsTed DiBiaseUndertakerTatankaYokozuna[CR]</plot>

				<plot>An adventurer named Dusty returns home with an enchanted Totem Pole. Due to an assortment of rare events, the spirits of the Totem have been freed and they have created a bizarre parallel universe that can devour the world. Lowman, the "head" of the Totem, needs some "muscle" as he calls it, to bring them back. He finds a pencil on the desk and makes it come to life. The pencil tells Lowman to call him Woody, WILLLLLLLLD Woody. Lowman explains what has happened with his Totem brothers and now Woody goes into the parallel universe, dimension by dimension, and rounds up Lowman's Totem brothers.[CR]In this game, you destroy your enemies by jumping on top of them and Woody can also wipe them out with his eraser. You can erase certain walls to get through them and you can also erase boxes that most of the time teleport if you press down. Other boxes contain items. You also can sketch things and they will come to life, but you can only do this twice because Woody shrinks very quickly from doing this. There are also power-ups that make you grow again.</plot>

				<title_clean>Wing Commander</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wing Commander is a single-player flight game that popularized the space flight simulator genre and paved the way for games such as the X-Wing/TIE Fighter series. A war rages between the Terran Confederation and the cat-like alien Kilrathi. The player is a rookie pilot on the Terran capital ship the TCS Tiger's Claw. Cinematic intros and a sythesized orchestral score provide a space opera feel.The single player campaign consists of a branching story arc that begins with the player in control of a lightly powered patrol craft. Continued success will lead to the unlocking of better equipped vessels. Failure will lead to missions with overwhelming odds, possibly resulting in the destruction of the Tiger's Claw and the end of the campaign. Campaign progress is broken up by adventure game style breaks in the pilot's lounge. The player can communicate with wingmates and fellow pilots using text-based menus and the dialogue will reflect previous mission results. If the wingmate dies on a mission, their chair/locker/barstool will be unoccupied and their name crossed off on the killboard.Missions are launched from the briefing room, with a series of checkpoints to visit and objectives to accomplish. Mission types offer some variety between patrols, escort duty, attack runs and investigations. Missions frequently change from their original description en route as the player encounters enemy Kilrathi and is forced to make snap decisions to maintain the mission.The game used 2D sprites rendered out at various angles to simulate a 3D entity in a similar way that Doom would use later to represent its computer controlled enemies. Even this simulated 3D experience taxed computer systems of the time to their limits; when played on the standard Amiga home computer, the framerate would often dip well into single digits when space battles got frantic.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wolfchild is a 2D shooter/platformer from British developers Core Design, which would later go on to create the Tomb Raider franchise. It features Saul Morrow, a man who is able to transform into a powerful werewolf form in order to fight the evil Chimera organization who kidnapped his scientist father Kal, from whom he received his powers. The game is a standard 2D platformer with shooting elements, and the player must collect energy before they can transform similar to Altered Beast.Wolfchild was originally released on the home computers Amiga and Atari ST, before being ported to various consoles like the Genesis, Master System, Mega-CD, SNES and Game Gear.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the score of 5 out of 10. He wrote, "...It's got great graphics, and some of the sound effects are dynamite, but Wolfchild loses big in the gameplay department. The punching and other attacks are awkward. This was a new idea, and the levels are huge, but the overall game is dull and rather unappealing".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]World Cup USA '94 is a soccer game developed by Tiertex Design Studios and published by U.S. Gold (SunSoft for Japanese releases) for multiple platforms. It is based on and licensed by the 1994 FIFA World Cup tournament, which was staged in nine cities across the United States of America. The 1994 World Cup mascot, a brown soccer-playing dog named Striker, features heavily in the game's menus and box art. The game was released on almost every home computer and console active in 1994. This would be the last officially produced FIFA World Cup game, as World Cup tournaments would be folded into EA Sports's annualized FIFA Soccer games.The Super Nintendo version of World Cup USA 94 features all 24 qualifying teams for the 1994 World Cup and eight additional teams that did not qualify (including England, Scotland, France, Japan and other countries that traditionally buy a lot of soccer games). Non-qualifying teams are marked with an asterisk (*). Other versions had different assortments of non-qualifying teams, including Canada, Austria, Uruguay and the former nation of Czechoslovakia.USAGermanyMexicoGreeceRussiaColombiaBrazilBoliviaSwitzerlandItalyNorwayEngland*Republic of Ireland (Eire)Scotland*Denmark*BelgiumRomaniaSwedenFrance*MoroccoCameroonArgentinaJapan*South KoreaPortugal*Netherlands (Holland)SpainWales*NigeriaSaudi ArabiaAustralia*Bulgaria [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>The Adventures Of Willy Beamish</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Willy Beamish is a point-and-click adventure game with several odd (especially at the time) game mechanics. It features the passage of time (certain events only take place at certain times of day) and Willy only has a certain amount of time to complete each "block" of time. It's a similar mechanic to that of Majora's Mask, albeit in a totally different genre. Secondly, the game features a "trouble meter" which indicates just how close Willy Beamish is to being sent to military school. If it fills up, the game is over.The game's universe is an odd mix of fantasy and reality, exemplified by one scene where Willy's babysitter turns out to be a practitioner of witchcraft. A puzzle-based boss battle ensues when she attempts to kill Willy and his sister.The game's cartoony look was accomplished by using hand-painted backgrounds and hand-animated sprites, like many adventure games of the era.Willy Beamish arguably pioneered the inclusion of everyday tasks in video games. Willy has to eat dinner and make conversation with his family, and at one point you have to disinfect and bandage your own finger after cutting it. It implements these tasks into the puzzle-solving elements of the game, and sometimes even make them integral to the plot.Willy Beamish's frog is named "Horny". [CR]Metagame[CR]Along with everyday mundane tasks, Willy can also head to his bedroom at most times to play the game-within-a-game: Monster Squad Super Space K'noidtrix for the Nintari game console. An interesting mix of Arkanoid and Tetris, puzzle-like pieces are thrown onto the playfield which must be avoided and destroyed before they stack up to the top of the screen. Several powerups can be shot and collected in the same manner as Arkanoid and can even be leveled up as rounds grow faster and harder. Combined with the peculiar soundtrack it makes for a decidedly Japanese feel in the middle of this Western-made game. [CR]System Requirements[CR]The original PC system requirements are:MS-DOS 5.0 or greater286 or better512 KB RAM8.5 MB Hard drive spaceVGAThunderboard Pro Aud Spectrum, AdLib, Roland MT-32/LAPC-1/CM-32L or SoundBlasterMouse[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Kingpin is at it again, and Spider-Man has just 24 hours to find the keys to defuse a bomb primed to wipe out New York City.  Worse, the Kingpin has convinced the citizens that Spider-Man is the bomb's mastermind, and they're now out for his radioactive spider blood.[CR]To clear Spider-Man's name, the player must guide him through multiple levels and familiar super-villains in search of the bomb's keys - all while the 24-hour time limit mercilessly counts down. At Spidey's disposal are a range of hand-to-hand combat moves, plus web tricks including stunning web shots, web swings, and a web shield.  Players can even form combos of web strikes and Spidey fists. And in a fairly uncommon platform maneuver, Spidey can stick to and crawl along any surface; including up walls and across ceilings.[CR]The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin for the Sega CD takes the idea and basic gameplay from the Genesis version, but makes some significant changes. There are new levels, new bosses, and an expanded set of combat moves. The player now has the freedom to select the next level or boss to tackle from a map screen. Graphics have also been redrawn and expanded from the Genesis release.  However, the player can no longer rest and heal at Peter Parker's apartment, or take photographs of enemies for cash; both prominent features of the Genesis version.[CR]Animated cutscenes with voices are new to this version, as well as a new CD soundtrack.  The player can also find and collect digital versions of classic Spider-Man comics, making further use of the multimedia storage space. A password system has also been added to save the player's progress.</plot>

				<title_clean>The Lawnmower Man</title_clean>
				<plot>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. [CR]With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.[CR]While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. [CR]The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</plot>

				<plot>The Masked Rider is a Japanese super hero, a man who has become genetically altered to be a man/grasshopper who rides a motorcycle. [CR]This FMV game adapts scenes from the movie Masked Rider ZO, and creates a Dragon's Lair style experience. The game centers around 10 battles of the film's 3 main characters.[CR]The player watches the video and hits the correct direction or button at the right time to achieve success. The visual cues of the movie suggest the correct buttons. For example, when the Masked Rider punches, the player should press the Punch button. If he dodges left on screen, the player should press the left direction pad.  Correct timing hits the enemy harder, lowering their health bar. Failure reduces the players health.[CR]Completing the moves accurately will allow the player to "defeat the monster early" and watch the rest of the video as a reward.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Guybrush Threepwood, a young man with desires to become a mighty pirate, travels to Melee Island, a pirate haven. Upon arrival he meets three " important looking pirates" in the SCUMM Bar who set him three challenges to test his worthiness. These entail defeating the legendary insult sword fighting master Carla, finding buried treasure and stealing a statue from the governors mansion. During a botched break-in to the mansion he meets and subsequently falls in love with the governor Elaine Marley. Elsewhere the ghost pirate LeChuck is seen pining after the love of his life, the same Elaine Marley, and hatches a plan to capture her. While Guybrush is busy finishing the trials LeChuck and his ghost pirate crew abduct her and take her to Monkey Island. Upon completing the trials Guybrush discovers this revelation, purchases a ship from Stan, a used ship salesman who informs him the ship requires a crew of four people. After gathering Carla, the sword fighting Master he had previously defeated, Meathook, a pirate with two hooks replacing his hands, and Otis a prisoner in Melee Island's Prison Guybrush and crew set sail in pursuit to rescue her.Upon setting sail Guybrush's crew mutinied against him, and decided to sunbathe instead. After following the instructions on his map to get to Monkey Island, he shoots himself onto the island.;Arriving at Monkey Island he discovers a strange band of cannibals and a hermit named Herman Toothrot. After helping the cannibals recover a lost voodoo ingredient they provide him with a recipe to destroy ghosts. When attempting to confront LeChuck however he finds only a single crewman who informs him of LeChuck's intention to marry Elaine on Melee Island. He sets sail once more.Returning to Melee Island he arrives at the church with intent to prevent the marriage but finds Elaine had her own plan of escape. LeChuck attacks Guybrush and after lengthy exchange the two arrive at the ship emporium whereupon Guybrush sprays LeChuck with root beer, the cannibals ghost fighting elixir being made from voodoo root. With LeChuck demise Guybrush and Elaine share a romantic moment, watching fireworks.[CR]Development[CR]Developed by Ron Gilbert, Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer, The Secret of Monkey Island began production shortly after Gilbert finished work on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The pirate premise of the game was inspired by Gilbert's love of The Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disneyland. His desire was to create a lush and fanciful world fill with swashbuckling pirates much like those seen in classic film and literature.The team's desire was to create a more accessible adventure game that anyone at any skill level could enjoy. Until then the genre had been known for being filled with difficult and often esoteric puzzles and full of trial and error gameplay. Gilbert and company hoped to avoid this by offering non linear puzzle sections such as The Three Trials where the player is free to work on a second puzzle if another becomes too difficult. The series also set the precedent in Lucasarts adventures of never allowing the player to die.Just before the game was set to ship, the company responsible for boxing the games and shipping to retailers told Lucasarts that they could not fill the order in time due to need to give their workers time off. This prompted nearly all of the Lucasarts staff to, themselves, box and ship all of the initial copies of The Secret of Monkey Island. Gilbert has said that during this time he, Grossman and Schafer each signed a one dollar bill and slipped it into one of the boxes. It's unknown if anyone ever found it.[CR]Insult Sword Fighting[CR]When sword fighting, it's not enough to have the right technique, you must also be able to parry an opponent's insults with appropriately witty responses. For example; the correct response to "You fight like a dairy farmer!" would be "How appropriate, you fight like a cow!". If the fighter responds with the correct come back, he earns the right to dish out the next insult. The first to three insults wins the fight.[CR]In-Jokes[CR]The Secret of Monkey Island is filled with references to Loom, another Lucasarts game released around the same time. Early in the game Guybrush encounters Cobb, a character from Loom who wears an "Ask me about Loom" button, who's only response to Guybush's attempts at conversation are "Aye". That is, however, until Guybrush asks him about Loom. Cobb then launches into full advertisement on the games excellent story and wonderful soundtrack. Other references to Loom include a seagull from them game and the line "I'm Bobbin, are you my mother?" after Guybrush is fired from a cannon.The game also takes a shot at fellow developer Sierra. At one point in the game the player can make Guybrush fall off a mountain resulting in a game over screen similar to those found in Sierra's adventure games that says "Oh, no! You've really screwed up this time! Guess you'll have to start over! Hope you saved the game!". After a few moments Guybrush flys back up the mountain and the game continues as normal.[CR]Easter Eggs[CR]When the ' Important Looking Pirates' in the Scumm Bar ask Guybrush if he has any special skills, one dialogue option is to tell them that he can hold his breath for 10 minutes. Later, when Fester Shinetop throws you into the water, if you wait 10 minutes you'll see Guybrush drown, bloat up, and a load is required.The Special Edition also includes a few references to past Lucas-Arts titles:In the cave where Le Chuck's vessel is anchored you'll see the face of Manny Calavera, the protogonist of Grim Fandango, hidden in one of the skull-filled speleothems.At the Giant Monkey Head there's an idol statue of The Purple Tentacle from Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle.[CR]The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition[CR]Special Edition Box ArtOn July 15, 2009, an updated "Special Edition" version of The Secret of Monkey Island was released on Xbox Live Arcade, PC, and iPhone/iPod touch (the game was later released on the PlayStation Network on April 22, 2010). This re-imagining has remained completely faithful to the original game, featuring updated 1080i graphics, new music, hand drawn recreations of all the characters, items, &amp; backgrounds, as well as full voice overs using the voice cast from The Curse of Monkey Island.The game has been given a streamlined interface designed to work better with a console controller. Players also have the ability to switch between the original version of the game and the special edition at any time with one button so that those who prefer the old style can still enjoy the experience. Moreover this version includes a built-in hint system for those who need it, which has three varying levels, but is a completely optional feature to use.[CR]PC System Requirements[CR]OriginalMS-DOS 5.0 or higher1 Mb of EMS required (2 Mb recommended)386/33 DX (486 DX recommended)Sounblaster and 100% compatibles, Adlib, Roland MT 32Special EditionWindows XP or VistaProcessor: Intel Pentium 4 3GHz or AMD Athlon 64 3000Memory: 256 MB RAM, 512 MB for VistaGraphics: 128 MB with Shader Model 2.0 capabilityDirectX: 9.0c (March 2009)Hard Drive: 2.5GB free hard drive spaceSound: DirectX 9.0c compliant sound card[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Similar to adaptations of The Terminator on other systems, the Sega CD game is a platformer where the player controls Kyle Reese, who travels back in time from the year 2029 to protect Sarah Connor from the unstoppable killing machine known as the Terminator.[CR]The game consists of 10 levels. Future locations include the post-apocalyptic wasteland of 2029 Los Angeles and the time displacement complex. In the present of 1984, Reese must traverse the streets and rooftops of L.A., as well as the Tech Noir club, the police station, and, for the finale, an automated factory. [CR]Reese is armed with a gun with unlimited ammo as well as a limited number of grenades to dispatch the many enemies, including Terminators and HKs in the future and punks in the present. In addition to these, several bosses must also be fought. The boss battles include several encounters with the Terminator, who naturally cannot be completely destroyed until the finale, but must be driven back to keep him from harming Sarah.[CR]Between levels, the game shows small digitized clips from the film that advance the storyline. The game also features a fully CD-based soundtrack with tracks ranging from heavy rock to electronic tunes.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Third World War is a turn-based strategy game for the Sega CD where the player takes on the role as the leader of one of sixteen world powers, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, during the Cold War or four hypothetical scenarios. The game is won either through economic supremacy over 60 regions or by conquering 51 regions militarily without starting a nuclear world war.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is split between a turn-based mode similar to Risk and a real-time strategy mode for invasions.Each turn starts with a roundup of random events and actions taken by the computer over the past turn. The player is then given a limited amount of actions and resources to develop their economy and military, conduct diplomacy and covert actions, and initiate military strikes before advancing on to the next month.If the player chooses to invade a country during that phase or if one of the player's regions is invaded, the game switches to real-time mode as the player controlled army clashes with the computer controlled opponent until one side is destroyed or surrenders.[CR]Scenarios[CR]The Third World WarA post-Cold War world of 1995 with the US as the sole world power, Russia and China in decline, and the lesser world powers vying to fill this power vacuum.The Cold WarSet in 1985 during the final stages of the cold war, the US and Russia are the dominant world powers, but are both slowly declining due to bloating military overspending that's could give room to new challengers on the world stage.War of the Pacific PowersIn this scenario Japan has become a dominant world power stuck in the middle between a growing China and the United States.ChaosA scenario where the developed nations of the world are in an economic and military decline while Iraq, Libya, South Africa and India are filling the void by building their own empires.The Economic StruggleA scenario focusing on economic warfare and control with more weight put on foreign investment and economic prowess than raw military might.[CR]Playable nations[CR]Sixteen countries are are playable in the game, comprising a total of 40 of the 85 in the game.These are the United States of America, Russia, Japan, China, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, India, South Africa, Brazil, Australia, Canada, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Libya. Each nation starts with different advantages in military, economic, and diplomatic terms with some being more difficult to play as than others.Other nations, such as Italy, Cuba and Sweden, are non-playable and only exist as regions in the game.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Time Gal</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Inspired by FMV laserdisc games such as Dragon's Lair and Ninja Hayate, Time Gal is a similarly structured arcade action-adventure filled with fully animated cutscenes and sequences. Players must lead Reika Kirishima through sixteen unique time periods and stop the evil Luda in his task to change history and gain power in his own time. As in Dragon's Lair, the player must think and react quickly to on-screen prompts in order to successfully guide Reika through each time period and face dangers such as dinosaurs in 70,000,000 BC and killer robots in the year 4000 AD.Time Gal features animation produced by Japanese studio Toei Animation, the studio responsible for numerous popular anime series and movies including the Dragon Ball franchise. The art and animation style is typical for mid to late 80's Japanese animation. The game was later ported to the Sega CD and saw a Western release in April of 1993. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>This is the first multimedia version of the classic Parker Brothers board game.  It uses photos, animations, videos &amp; voice clips to pose over 2000 questions and answers to Trivial Pursuit questions.[CR]In the Classic Game, up to 6 players roll an on-screen die and move their 'pie-dish' marker around the spoke-and-wheel game board, just like the board game.  The square you land on is color coded to one of six trivia categories:  People &amp; Places, Sports &amp; Leisure, History, Arts &amp; Entertainment, Science &amp; Nature, and Wild Card.  Answering the trivia question correctly lets you take another turn.[CR]Further, if you are on the 'prize' square at the end of each spoke (1 spoke end for each category color), the correct answer grants you a colored pie piece in your pie-dish marker for that category.  Once you have all 6 pie pieces in your dish, you need to head back to the hub for a final random question to win the game.[CR]In the Fast Game, up to 6 players can forgo the die-rolling and board movement.  It's a race to answer correctly a question from each category first!  Categories are randomly selected in this mode.</plot>

				<plot>Remember the days as a kid when you were fascinated with these big machines on the building site? With this game you have the opportunity to try them out! You can use either the excavator, bulldozer, steamroller or wrecking ball. The handling couldn't be easier, there are just three buttons to press: left, right and use.[CR]With each machine you get a simple task, e.g. carry three shovels of dirt on a truck. But the fun thing is that you aren't restricted to this and can just screw around. Why wreck an old house when the pit latrine is so much more tempting? The whole game is presented in full motion video - the reactions are very humorous and with a fair share of slapstick. To improve the long time motivation there are even multiple videos for every action, e.g. the first time you break a road block with the the excavator you drive on a highway, the second time into a canyon, the third time onto a rollercoaster and so on...</plot>

[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] You will see common old west environmentsAlthough the setting is different, Gunfighters has the same gameplay as the orginal Lethal Enforcers.

There are five stages in Gunfighters: The Bank Robbery, The Stage Hold-Up, Saloon Showdown, The Train Robbery, and The Hide Out. Each level visits environments that are often scene in old western films. The structure of each level takes you through a shooting gallery of enemies, where eventually you will meet a boss. Their are numerous weapons appropriate to the Western theme that can make the player more powerful. The weapons you pick up will make boss encounters much easier to complete.Gunfighters has a score or ranking system based on how many enemies or innocent people you shoot. You are able to obtain a ranking of Posse, Deputy, Sheriff, Deputy Marshal, and U. S. Marshal.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lethal Enforcers was first released into American arcades by Konami on Oct. 14, 1992. Considered to be the first in the police simulator sub-genre of light-gun shooters, it, along with Mad Dog McCree and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, became wildly popular in arcades and ushered in a Golden Age for light-gun shooters. The success of Lethal Enforcers led to the development of franchises such as Virtua Cop and Time Crisis, both of which borrow heavily from the game's core design and concepts.The player takes the role of a police officer from Chicago named Don Marshall, who battles a major crime syndicate that has invaded the city (with a "partner" if played with 2 players) through 5 levels. The stages, in order, are "The Bank Robbery", "Chinatown Assault", "The Hijackers", "Drug Dealers", and "Chemical Plant". In each stage, Don has to shoot criminals that pop out of the scenery before they shot him. Occasionally an innocent civilian appears instead, and by shooting them Don loses health and penalizes the player's final score. Don can collect additional weapons throughout the level that are more powerful than his standard gun, such as a magnum or shotgun, but they are lost if hit.In the Arcades, players used a plastic revolver-like light-gun to play the game, called the "Konami Justifier". The gun was colored blue for Player 1 and pink for Player 2. The standard gun in the game has 6 shots, and to reload the gun players has to fire the trigger off-screen. On home versions of the game, players can use a gun that is bundled with the game, or a standard controller.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Links redefined what golf on the PC should look and play like; it migrated golf from a sports game to a simulation.  Good use of VGA's 256 colors made for a realistic course with trees, water, sandtraps, and the fairway.  The addition of ball physics, mulligans, changing the lie of the ball, real digitized environmental sounds (even through the PC speaker), and the ability to view a replay (even from multiple angles) gave PC golf games a new echelon of quality to match.  [CR]Links catapulted to the top rung of the golf simulation ladder and the series has managed to stay there for over a decade.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Loadstar: The Legend of Tully Bodine was developed by Rocket Science Games and published by BMG Interactive. The game was released on PC and Sega CD. Loadstar features full motion video. The live action video features several actors such as Ned Beatty and Bary Primus. The game is divided in three episodes with a finale. There are cinematic sequences that separate action phases between them and show the events along the game.  [CR]Plot  [CR]Set in the 22nd Century, the game places you as the captain of a cargo ship trying to escape from a Moon base. This man is Tully Bodine. Tully is an interplanetary trucker looking for his last haul before rejoining his new girlfriend who is waiting for him somewhere on Mars. Unfortunatly for Tully, the local sheriff, Wombley, does not appreciate him very much, and is looking to catch him in the act of something illegal.  Luckily for Tully, he finds and accepts a haul to convey a cargo of contraband camels to Phobos for big cash, and he as to hurry before Wombley catches him and throws him into jail cell.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]During the game, you will receive instructions from Mortimer, the ship's computer. The controls for the game are simple,with you having to steer the ship to the left or the right with the arrow keys, use the shields with the up arrow, and horn with the down arrow. You can also use a joystick, by buttons to horn and activate the shields. You will move your visor with the joystick and shoot at the targets with the fire button.Your first mission will consist in delivering the cargo within 9 minutes which is not easy at all. If you choose the wrong track along the way, you are on for another turn before you get back to the junction and make the good choice. Fortunately, Mortimer will indicate you the right direction but sometimes you are so busy trying to blow up things around you that you don't even have time to steer the ship.  Another thing to watch out is the incoming traffic. If you react too slowly to Mortimer's warnings, you will end up in a collision with the traffic, causing an explosion and your untimely death along with the loss of one life. Another kind of traffic hazard is the slow traffic. The only way not to bump into is to buzz your horn and make them speed up their engines. It will prevent you from further damages.  The damages can be repaired in zones that Mortimer will indicate to you, but the best way to stay alive is to use your shields when you are attacked. Finally, at the end of each episode, you will have to destroy a boss that is chasing you around.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Lords Of Thunder</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title screen. Lords of Thunder (called Winds of Thunder in Japan) is a side scrolling shooter developed by RED and published by Hudson for the Turbo CD and Sega CD. Beyond its gameplay, the game is probably best known for its heavy metal soundtrack.  [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Landy versus Zaggart. Lords of Thunder's plot follows the attempted resurrection of an evil god named Deoric (Zaggart in the PC Engine version) by a force of six evil generals who serve the Dark Priest Zonbul of the Gald Kingdom. The player controls a brave knight by the name of Landy (a.k.a. Duran) who is granted a variety of magical armor by the goddess Farina. The generals have conquered the six kingdoms of Mistral to channel energy to the tower of Gald in order to revive Zaggart; Landy has to stop them all before it's too late![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The shop. Lords of Thunder's horizontal-scrolling shooting is augmented by a choice of four elemental armors and a shop that sells useful items before he enters the fray. Landy can also strike with his sword by moving close to the enemy and holding down the attack button; he continues to shoot as normal as well, and the sword strikes are quite powerful! Each armor also has a different effect when a "bomb" is used.Wind Armor: The wind armor fires moderately powerful shots straight forward; its power is simply increased as the weapon energy gauge is filled. The least useful armor. When a bomb is used in the wind armor, waves of lightning are emitted in both directions from Landy.Water Armor: Shoots waves of blue energy in addition to the basic shot. As this weapon is leveled up the energy waves become larger and more powerful; at max level waves are also fired backwards. The waves are strong and penetrate certain types of walls, making this a very easy to use armor. Perhaps tellingly, Landy is depicted as wearing this on the game's cover and in the game's cutscenes... When a bomb is used in the water armor, the screen is covered with spinning whirlpool like objects.Fire Armor: A basic armor with flame-based attacks. At max level the explosive fire shots evolve in to a powerful flame-thrower which is moderately controllable based on the player's movement. When a bomb is used in the fire armor a fiery salamander is summoned to destroy enemies.Earth Armor: The earth armor fires an extremely powerful "bomb" type-projectile towards the ground at an arc in front of Landy. When leveled half-way it also shoots one towards the ceiling; at max level they emit large shockwaves and are easily the most powerful attacks in the game. Get in close on bosses' weak points to kill them extremely fast! When a bomb is used in the earth armor meteors rain from the heavens.ItemsMost of these items can only be purchased at the store; however, crystals and a couple of other items are dropped by enemies, too!  A "fairystone" bomb.Crystals: The basic currency to be used at the shop, these are dropped by all sorts of enemies. Blue crystals are worth five and red are worth twenty-five.Lifestone: The variety dropped in stages, this restores three points of life to Landy. Quite rare!Magic stone: The variety dropped in stages, these increase Landy's weapon power. Blue ones add one point of weapon power and red ones add five.Lifestone (lv1): Only available at the shop, this adds two points of life to Landy's life meter.Lifestone (lv2): Only available at the shop, this adds five points of life to Landy's life meter.Lifestone (max): Only available at the shop, this completely fills Landy's life meter!Magic stone (lv1): Only available at the shop, this adds 3 to Landy's weapon meter.Magic stone (lv2): Only available at the shop, this adds 8 to Landy's weapon meter.Magic shield (lv1): A barrier that allows Landy to take a hit without taking damage.Magic shield (lv2): A slightly superior magic shield, this allows Landy to take two free hits.Magic shield (lv3): The best of the magic shields, this allows Landy to take three hits.Fairy stone: These are the "bombs" of the game, and their effect depends on the armor being worn when they are used. Up to three can be stored at one time.Elixir: This expensive item will completely restore Landy's life meter once when it has been fully depleted.Continue: Allows the player to continue if they get a game over![CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]The game's first six stages can be completed in any order.AuzalAuzal - the water stage: A watery area full of water dragons, jellyfish and winged soldiers. A strange monster is encountered as a mid-boss; a large portion of the stage takes place under water. Auzal is controlled by general Aspidd, who transforms in to a large half-snake beast headed demon for her duel with Landy.Dezant - the desert stage: This stage is filled with the basic magic flying soldiers who will trouble Landy throughout the game; half-way through the stage Landy descends in to a cave only to have to escape it in a high-speed sequence while avoiding the collapsing roof and enemies riding platforms covered with rotating blades. General Scorpion controls this area, transforming in to a large insectoid monster to fight Landy. Helado - the ice stage: With strong enemies and tricky obstacles this stage isn't to be taken lightly! Avoid getting blown around by the ice-faces in the cave and don't get crushed by falling icicles! This area is controlled by general Matansha, who transforms in to a kirin like beast.Cielom Cielom - the sky stage: Landy flies high in to the sky while battling rotating flame-spewing skulls and suicidal spearmen who leap from flying turtles and the windows of a huge flying cathedral. The cathedral proper is also defended by large iron golems. The boss is general Pajarona, second in command only to the dark priest Zonbul himself.Bosque - the forest stage: A creepy forest full of strange and dangerous wildlife, including man-eating plants, pulsing pods, and titanic insects. General Jardein is in command here; he transforms in to a massive creature which can fire a powerful stream of energy from its weak point.LlamaradaLlamarada - the volcano stage: The player must guide Landy up the outside of a volcano while avoiding fragments from an eruption and then down inside of the volcano to a fortress inside of it! Unsurprisingly this area is full of fiery enemies, including phoenixes and multi-headed firebreathing beasts. The intimidatingly named General Ballrender has mastery over the denizens here; he transforms in to a large demonic warrior with the power to seperate in to spheres. Zonbul's battle form. The seventh stage, the Dark Tower of Gald, is automatically entered after completing the first six stages. The first part is a typical stage where Landy advances up the tower to fight Zonbul at the end; the second segment involves Landy being granted infinite weapon energy by the Goddess Farina for the final duel with Zaggart.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Game disc.Like many disc-based games of the early 90s, Lords of Thunder takes advantage of the CD format with heavy metal instrumental music that goes far beyond hardware limitations of the era. The soundtrack was produced by Japanese music house T's Music.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Lunar - Eternal Blue</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A classically styled Japanese RPG, the game centers around a small band of heroes traveling the world of Lunar via a World Map. Scattered throughout that overworld map are towns, cities, and outposts where the player can interact with NPCs, buy new equipment and items, and heal themselves at Goddess Shrines. These areas act as respites where the player can progress the story in a narrative fashion. Dungeons, shrines, temples, and many other dungeon-like areas are also scattered throughout the overworld map of Lunar. In these areas, the player can progress the story through fighting enemies and bosses. The player will also fight in Lunar's overworld map while traveling from one place to another. The game is largely linear but the player can backtrack and even, after a certain point, travel around the world of Lunar if they so choose.The fighting system is menu driven and turn-based. Each turn, the player can either issue commands to each character in their party or allow the computer, through a pre-fight A.I. option, to fight for them. The player can have up to five characters in their party at any one time. The only character the player can't control is Lucia. Lucia will change her fighting techniques as the story progresses. Her health is dictated by Hiro's health. Each character can fight by performing a normal attack, using magic, defending themselves, using an item, running away, or the player can let the computer decide what that specific character will do for that turn with the A.I. option. The character's location relative to the enemy will determine if, and how well, they will be able to attack that enemy. Melee characters require close proximity to the enemy while magic users and ranged characters can fight at a distance. The characters' locations can be determined by the player in the options screen before or after a battle. The player can also set up multiple tactics in the game's option menu that can be selected at the start of each battle. If all of the characters in the player's party die the game ends.Each character is defined by a number of stats that determine how they perform in battle. These stats will improve as the player fights more enemies and gains more and more experience points. After a certain amount of experience points are earned, the characters will level up. Each level comes with increased stats and, occasionally, new abilities. Each character has a certain number of hit-points and magic-points. The character passes out (or dies) once their hit-points reach zero. Each magical ability uses a specific allotment of magic-points. When a character's magic-points reach zero that character can no longer use magic. As the characters level up their hit-points and magic-points increase. After each battle, Hiro's companion Ruby is given magic experience points (MEP). MEP is used to save the player's game (which can be done anywhere as long as the player has enough MEP). MEP can also be used to increase the levels of each magical ability each character has. As a magical ability increases so does its usefulness.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]HiroRubyLuciaGwynLeminaJeanRonfarAlthenaNallGhaleonWhite Knight LeoBlue Master LunnBlack Wizard MorganRed Priest MauriZophar[CR]Playstation Remake[CR]This game was remade in 2001 for the PlayStation.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lunar is a role-playing game developed by Game Arts and Studio Alex for the Sega CD. The game centers around the main protagonist, Alex, a young boy from a small town who dreams to one day become a hero like his idol, Dragonmaster Dyne. The game begins with Alex and his friends going on a child hood adventure and stumbling upon an ancient dragon. They then begin a journey across the world to gather the necessary power to become the next Dragonmaster, and save the world.Game Arts set out to create a story that would break away from the, "hum-drum 'model" games that "had stories, but had no story-telling" when they created Lunar. They chose the Sega CD as their platform for it's video playback capabilities and hired on animator and artist Toshiyuki Kubooka to oversee the planning of the video sequences and voice overs. Novelist Kei Shigema was then hired on to pen the script and plot to the game. The team decided to focus on on a fantasy world heavy in mythos and history that would gradually reveal itself to players over time. Studio Alex handled most of the developing of the title.[CR]American Development[CR]The American development and translation was handled by Working Designs. They completed the text translation in an 8 week marathon programming session. During the translation they added in their own humor, mostly in the form of pop culture references from the early 90s such as allusions to American commercials, celebrities, colloquialisms, products, and role-playing game cliches. Working Designs president  Victor Ireland took the project very seriously. He often collaborated with the original Japanese development team. He also added in a couple of new sequences he felt enhanced the game and story, including the scene where we see Alex play the harp to awaken Luna.Ireland's biggest contribution which many fans would thank him for is Lunar's packaging. He made sure extra effort was put into the game's packaging, giving the instruction booklet embossed lettering, and having seven separate disc stamps, each with different artwork, produced for the front of the game discs -- all in the effort to increase collection value. Below are stamps 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 (missing are 3 and 5). Stamp 1 is the most common and they get more rare as they go with stamp 7 being the most difficult to obtain. As you can see disc 1 and 2 look nearly identical. Disc 1 was manufactured by SEGA and they were not familiar with the "groove fill" process. For this reason Working Designs made disc 2 the same art, but filled it all the way. Working Designs also manufactured, under their direct control, discs 2-7 for quality assurance reasons.[CR]Reception [CR]The game was released in Japan on June 26, 1992 to critical acclaim, and became the number 1 selling game on the Sega CD of all time in Japan selling an estimated 100,000 copies, or nearly as many Sega CD consoles sold in Japan. The game launched on December 1, 1993 in America, also to much acclaim. It would go on to be the second best selling game world wide for the Sega CD, behind only Sonic the Hedgehog CD.[CR]Remakes[CR]The game was been re-made on three separate occasions.  Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete was released on the  Sega Saturn in Japan on October 15, 1996 and included redrawn graphics, a polished script, and new music by  Noriyuki Iwadare. This version was then expanded upon in July 1997 with the addition of an MPEG expansion card for the  Saturn. The updated MPEG version was then ported to the  Playstation in 1998, and Working Designs then handled another English translation and brought the  Playstation version stateside in May 1999. A  Windows PC version was also released in 1999, exclusively in Korea and Japan -- the North American version was canceled for technical difficulties.  Lunar Legend is a retelling of the events of Lunar Silver Star on the  Game Boy Advance. Developed by  Japan Art Media and published in America by  Ubisoft,  Lunar Legend deviates more than any of the other re-makes. The dialogue and situations that characters face are noticeably different. The FMV sequences were replace with still screens to tell the story. The game was released in March 2002 in Japan and the following year in America. The American release did not feature any of the pop culture and quirky humor that  Working Designs was known for, as they were not involved with this version.  Lunar: Silver Star Harmony was released on March 2nd 2010 in North America for the  Playstation Portable both digitally on  PSN and on UMD via retailers. This remake includes a new isometric view, new hand-drawn style graphics for the characters and backgrounds, complete voice over throughout for the lead character ( Alex), new cut-scenes to help clear up gaps in the story, and a remixed soundtrack.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Dark Wizard is a tactics-based, fantasy role-playing game developed by  Sega for the  Sega CD. It was conceptualized by  Kenji Terada who was notable for his work as scenario writer for the first three  Final Fantasy games. Released in Japan in 1993 as Dark Wizard: Yomigaerishi Yami no Madoushi and in the United States in 1994, Dark Wizard features turn-based strategic combat played on a hex field map that progresses from one battle scenario to the next interspersed with brief cutscenes to advance the story. This single-player game also features an orchestral soundtrack and long animated sequences complete with voice-acting. The setting takes place in the once-peaceful lands of Cheshire now overrun by the demonic hordes of Velonese, a former wizard apprentice imbued with the powers of a dark god. The player chooses one of four characters who becomes the ruler of Cheshire to launch a counterattack from the remote kingdom of Quentin - the last stronghold under human control. The leader's task is to push back the invasion and liberate other kingdoms seized by the Demon Army. Each ruler has his or her own self-contained storyline and motivation for waging war against Velonese as well as unique powers, attributes and units available to them.   [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The gameplay in Dark Wizard largely involves the player taking command of a party comprised of warriors, priests, mages and summoned creatures against an opposing army of demons led by a powerful commander. Each side uses a turn to assign up to two actions per unit until the player manually ends the turn. These actions involve such choices as movement, or moving then attacking when in close enough proximity to a foe. Movement is governed by hex tiles on the battlefield. How far a unit can travel is determined by its ability to cross certain types of terrain based on its class and statistics. The objective in most scenarios is to vanquish the opposing commander as it is not mandatory to defeat all enemies on the map to win the battle. Units can only move to hexes that appear clear.Once a battle is won, several options open up. One of these is buying and selling equipment for troops all from within a handy menu. Another is to assemble a search party to seek out rare items, although members of this group will not be present for the subsequent battle. Troops can also be sent out to guard previously conquered maps as they can be retaken by the Demon Army. The option to advance to the next map is also available but is limited to land adjacent to the ruler's current location. As leader, the player is able to build an army from scratch and oversee its development. As long as the main character is situated on a castle, up to six units that are neutral or of the leader's own alignment can be hired or summoned per turn. Hirelings are all humanoids (dwarves, hobbits, elves and humans) who become warriors, mages and priests and are paid in gold with tax money collected from liberated castles and cities. The leader can also use magic points (MP) to summon a menagerie of creatures such as dragons, hydras, chimeras and griffins. Every unit grows in power by gaining experience points (EXP) through casting spells, inflicting damage, receiving damage, killing a foe or a combination of these actions. Once a unit accumulates enough experience points it will gain a level. When a certain level is reached (usually level five or ten), the unit is promoted to a more powerful class. Each of the alignments has its own unique class progression.Alignment is an important gameplay mechanic generally divided into three categories: Lawful, Neutral and Chaotic. It determines not only the types of units a leader can acquire and the weapons humanoid units can equip, but also adjusts their degree of power depending on the time of day. In the daytime, Lawful units gain a slight advantage and Chaotic units are slightly disadvantaged and the opposite is true of nighttime. A fourth alignment, Undead, is attributed to a number of units of the Demon Army as well as one of the main protaganists, the vampire Amon, and most of his summoned minions. Gameplay-wise, the Undead alignment essentially functions as Chaotic with principal differences being resistance to most spells, susceptibility to fire and the availability of certain creatures.   Speaking to everyone in town is never a bad thing. Ever.Reclaiming cities and castles plays a crucial role in sustaining the player's army. This is the primary means of maintaining a steady flow of income to insure all hirelings get paid, aside from selling various items to NPCs in cities. Each liberated city yields approximately 2 to 20 gold per turn while castles yield 20 to 100 gold depending on the leader's economic strength rating. During each battle, humanoid units are able to enter cities and interact with NPCs to buy or sell weapons, armor, potions and even alcoholic beverages. Speaking with NPCs allows the player to advance the plot, catch up on the latest gossip, or even accept side quests. Additionally, a sub-leader of which there are two for each main character can only be obtained through NPC dialogue. Sub-leaders are powerful characters in their own right secondary only to the ruler. [CR]Main Characters[CR]There are four main characters or rulers to choose from, each of whom has a reason for wanting to slaughter Velonese the eponymous Dark Wizard - whether it be a commendable fight for freedom or simply to prove one's superiority. Every leader will be joined by two sub-leaders who vary depending on which ruler is selected.   Armer IX - Lawful PrinceArmer IXThe noble prince who is the rightful heir to the throne of Cheshire after his father, Armer VIII, is killed in battle against the Demon Army. He is joined by a sorceress, Marie, and Dianna, a warrior.Robin - Lawful WarriorRobinConsidered the finest warrior in the land, Robin takes the reigns as ruler out of loyalty not only to Cheshire, but to her slain sovereign as well. She is joined by an old priest, Kail, and David, a mighty warrior.Krystal - Chaotic SorceressKrystalA sorceress tricked by Velonese to kill Armer VIII under false pretenses, Krystal will stop at nothing to sate her thirst for vengeance. She is joined by a warrior, Marcus, and Katrina, a priestess. Amon - Undead Vampire LordAmonVampire and lord of the undead, Amon refuses to acknowledge Velonese or even the dark god Arliman as masters of the night and vows to prove his point. He murders the king and assumes his form to take charge of the assault against the Demon Army. He is joined by a sorceress, Susan, and Andrew, a vampire hunter. [CR]Backstory [CR]    Three hundred years ago, the noble king Rishon ruled over the prosperous lands of Cheshire. At the time, the harmonious synergy between Sabrina, the goddess of daylight and Arliman, the god of night, reigned supreme. The people of Cheshire benefited greatly from the   abundance of life provided by both deities and the   wise leadership of their king. However, Rishon's high priest Zahark, sought to upset the balance of power and set a devious plan in motion.    Knowing full well the jealousy the dark god Arliman harbored for Sabrina's divine radiance, Zahark set out to use this to his advantage in his powergrab for Cheshire's throne. Using a forbidden spell to bring Arliman to life and grant him physical form, Zahark was rewarded with arcane powers to assist in the dark god's impending conquest.  Sensing the imminent threat, Sabrina acted swiftly and soon discovered who was responsible for the distressing break in peace. She appointed two renowned leaders to battle the demonic onslaught and granted each of them holy powers. One of these leaders was the beautiful and wise Armer, and the other a mighty warrior named Vian. Armer was charged with eliminating Zahark, while Vian was left with the monumental task of facing Arliman with the aid of the grand wizard Gilliam. In the heat of battle, Gilliam cast a powerful spell that encased Arliman into what became known as the Jewel of Darkness. Although the dark god was defeated, Vian disappeared and was never heard from again.   With the threat of eternal darkness across the land thwarted, the people looked toward a new leader as the great Rishon had been slain during the war. Armer, the celebrated heroine, ascended to the throne as ruler of Cheshire which ushered in a new era of peace. Heeding the wise edicts of Rishon, Armer presided justly over a once-again prosperous land. Meanwhile, Velonese, the head apprentice of the grand wizard Gilliam, began performing forbidden rituals of the dark arts in secret. He was eventually found out, and needed to be made an example for his grave indiscretions. Velonese was sentenced to solitude on the isle of Raven to forever guard the Jewel of Darkness that imprisoned the  malevolent god Arliman. Gilliam, being a wizard of tremendous power, possessed knowledge of the Spell of Immortality and cast it upon Velonese so that he may carry out his sentence for all eternity.  For three hundred years, the hatred Velonese held for the outside world festered as he finally discovered a means to draw upon the vile essence of Arliman from within the Jewel of Darkness. Using the forbidden knowledge which sentenced him to damnation in the first place, Velonese unleashed onto the world the powers he mastered during his excruciatingly lonesome captivity. With these unholy powers, four monstrous demon generals were spawned from the ribs of Velonese to lead his armies and decimate the lands of Cheshire as he prepares to free Arliman from the Jewel of Darkness. The unexpected ferocity of the Demon Army forced King Armer VIII's legions to cede more and more land until they were pressed into a corner. This last bastion of freedom known as Quentin is the only hope of rallying the troops and striking back against the Dark Wizard.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Demolition Man is a side-scrolling action game (with top-down shooter levels) that is based on the 1993 sci-fi movie of the same name. It was released on SNES, Genesis, Sega CD and 3DO - the two 16-bit console versions and the Sega CD and 3DO versions have some distinct differences based on the multimedia capabilities of the CD format of the latter two versions.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Super criminal Simon Phoenix rules the war torn remnants of Los Angeles and it's time for Officer John Spartan to bring him to justice! Capture Simon and send him to serve his sentence frozen in a block of ice for all eternity. Pursue Simon again when he is unwittingly thawed out in a Utopian future free of crime! Can you catch history's worst criminal a second time with only the help of a lax and unprepared police force? Can you figure out how the three sea shells work!?[CR]Version Differences[CR]Shooting scene from 3DO Version.The Genesis and SNES versions of Demolition Man were wildly different from the Sega CD and 3DO versions.The 16-bit version of the game contained two types of levels: side-scrolling shooter missions and top-down missions in which John Spartan must rescue hostages. The 32-bit versions of the game featured fully digitized character graphics much like the Mortal Kombat games. Sylvester Stallone himself also acted in the game, though clearly in front of a green screen. The levels varied from an on-rails shooter in the vein of Operation Wolf and the NES Punisher game, to hand to hand combat levels with Simon Phoenix that played much like a toned down fighter.Fighting scene from 3DO   [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Eddie (  Corey Haim) is trapped in the basement of his own house. He got you in through the phone lines to trap  burglars, and to find a code to set him free. There are a few tenants living in the house, like a mobster that just got out of jail, a female wannabe reporter looking for a story, two young female students, a rock band, and a weird handyman that Eddie doesn't seem to like too much. What's their story, and why is Eddie really trapped in the basement?[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is basically the same as in  Night Trap, only this time it has evolved, so you don't need to endlessly switch rooms just to see if something is happening. Instead, on the left side of the screen you have a  heads up display that shows you a map of the house with all the rooms laid out. When someone breaks into a room, an alarm goes off, and the room on your HUD starts flashing. When a person enters a room, an icon appears. A green icon is a tenant, a yellow one is for unknowns, and red icons are bad guys.There are two traps in every room, each with a spring. Choose which trap you want to set off, tighten the spring, and once the person you want to trap steps on a certain mark on the floor, you'll hear a sound indicating that he or she is in place. Spring the trap and watch the bad guy go away. Be careful that you don't trap any of the tenants though, or Eddie will disconnect you.As the story progresses, and you do your job trapping bad guys, you will also need to find a code to get Eddie out of the basement. The code appears in different power boxes around the house, so pay attention when someone opens one up. Also, be extra careful that someone doesn't get their hands on the power box in the basement. If the power goes out, everyone is cut off, and it's  game over.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Dracula Unleashed is an FMV game developed by ICOM Simulations and Viacom New Media. It was published on the Sega CD by Sega and the PC by Viacom New Media in 1993. The story takes place a few years after the events of Bram Stoker's Dracula and all of the main characters from the novel are represented here. The player assumes the role of Alexander Morris, a wealthy Texan, who travels to Victorian England to investigate the death of his brother Quincey.  As Morris you navigate the city seeking out any and all who may have information about the death of your brother. Each "location" is merely a different film sequence which will offer the player clues and infomation. Unlike the  Sherlock Holmes  games, you must stay aware of time and your inventory. Entering houses with different items in your hand, or at different times of the day will trigger different sequences, and certain pivotal scenes can be missed entirely if you mismanage time.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Dragon's Lair</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dirk the Daring's fluid animation and unparalleled visual detail helped make Dragon's Lair a hit.Dragon's Lair was first released as a Laserdisc arcade game in 1983 by Cinematronics, featuring artwork created by former Disney animator Don Bluth. Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as Space Ace, Bega's Battle, and Cliff Hanger.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne. Daphne has been kidnapped by Singe the Dragon, and is now being held in the castle. Dirk's adventure will have him battling monsters and the castle alike as he attempts to save the day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.The gameplay of Dragon's Lair varies wildly from version to version, a common misconception is that the "Quick Time Event" game is the only version of Dragon's Lair in existence, however on platforms like the NES and SNES, Dragon's Lair is a 2D platformer requiring players to navigate multi-tiered stages, finding one of multiple exits to complete a level and progress through the castle to the final boss fight. The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different "chapters" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the Quick Time Event, featured in games like Shenmue, Resident Evil 4, and Heavy Rain.In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played "in reverse" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last "life" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.[CR]Development[CR]Dragon&#8217;s Lair was the brain child of Rick Dyer, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic &#8220;Adventure&#8221; was another inspiration for Dragon&#8217;s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn&#8217;t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic&#8217;s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade Port[CR]On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to Xbox Live Arcade. The port is developed by Digital Leisure and published by Microsoft Studios. The Xbox Live Arcade port includes support for the standard controller, as well as Kinect.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Goddess of Ambition is locked up in the mazes beneath the Darkling tower. A legend is told that once rescued she will grant any wish. A group of heroes stranded in a strange world must attempt to free this divine creature and use her powers to return home.[CR]Dungeon Explorer is a Gauntlet clone. Like that classic game, it is a hybrid between an arcade shooter and a traditional RPG. It supports up to 4 players with a choice of 6 different characters/classes: monk, knight, elf, mage, beast and ninja. On the right side of the screen there is a bar with portraits of the characters: pressing the A button brings up the status menu that displays the current level, experience points, statistics, and equipment. The C button fires the equipped weapon, and the B button uses the character's special ability.[CR]The game starts in the area surrounding a save point. This area functions as a central hub to access all the 6 dungeons. If a character leaves it, the food counter starts decreasing. If it reaches zero, the life points start diminishing until the character dies. Food can be found as potions or pots around the mazes. Returning the character to the save point area replenishes all the counters and cures all conditions (like poisoning and confusion). To the north there are two buildings, a weapon shop and a tavern. The gold collected on the game is spent on equipment upgrades at the weapons shop. The tavern (called Jojo's Bar) allows the player to switch characters. [CR]The characters level up automatically as they amass the necessary experience points. Once a dungeon boss is defeated, the dungeon is locked and the player can't return to it. The game has four save slots, each one for an individual game.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]ESPN Baseball Tonight is a baseball game from Park Place Productions (Stormfront Studios developed the PC port) and published by Sony Imagesoft (now 989 Studios). It features the ESPN (the TV network) license and the MLB license, but not the MLBPA license.Like a few baseball games out at this time, the game features a lower perspective of the field while pitching/batting, almost level with the batter's POV. The screen doesn't transition to an overhead view while fielding, unlike many other baseball games. Along with the traditional tournament and exhibition modes, the player can try their hand at a Home Run Derby and receives a score based on how many homers they hit.ESPN Baseball Tonight was originally released on the Sega CD in 1993. It received additional versions for the core Sega Genesis system, the Super Nintendo and PC MS-DOS, all in 1994. It would be followed by other ESPN-branded sports games, the next being ESPN Sunday Night NFL in August 1994. [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Ecco - The Tides Of Time</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ecco: The Tides of Time is a direct follow-up to the 1993 game, Ecco the Dolphin and developed by Novotrade International (now Appaloosa Interactive). The controls of the first game are identical to the second one, as with the difficulty. It includes all new puzzles such as a Scavenger hunt. There are also new powers, one of them includes Ecco changing into different animals such as a jellyfish, a seagull, a shark and a school of fish. With these new additions, many things from the original game came back. The health and air meter are back along with the Glyphs.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story starts off where the last leaves off: The Vortex Queen is back and follows Ecco back to earth to begin a new hive. Ecco lost his powers from the Ast erite and after he encountered a dolphin with long fins named, Trellia, who was his descendant. She took Ecco to her present which was his future.In Ecco&#8217;s future, Dolphins evolved with telekinetic powers and the power to fly with helium sacks that were on them. The ocean had a mind of its own with &#8216;skyways&#8217; or waterways that floated trough the skies, which connected other parts of water on the earth. Ecco, who was exploring the future, then found the Asterite.When talking to the Asterite, it told Ecco that something was wrong. When Ecco used the time machine the world split into two. One which was a joyful future with flying dolphins, the other was a lifeless wasteland which was dried up by the vortex. Even though the Asterite was killed by the Vortex Queen not until later it was explained how it was talking to Ecco. It then sent him back to the present.Ecco pieced the Asterite together by bringing the globes that made up the creature. The last of the globes had been taken by the Vortex to the future; Ecco had to retrieve them before both he and Asterite could defeat the vortex. They both went to the vortex future that was full of bizarre machines and was much like the last levels of Ecco the Dolphin. Eventually Ecco found the Astrite&#8217;s last two globes and went back to the present.The Asterite was complete again and Ecco got all of his powers back again.Ecco then fought the Vortex Queen using the song to destroy her. Though she escaped to the Atlantean time machine, the Asterite told Ecco to destroy it; instead he uses it to and disappears in to the Tides of Time.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Ecco The Dolphin</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ecco the Dolphin (also known as Ecco) is an aquatic side-scrolling action-adventure game developed by Novotrade and published by Sega for the Genesis in Europe (on July 31, 1992), North America (on December 29, 1992), and Japan (on July 30, 1993).Players control a bottlenose dolphin named Ecco (unique to other dolphins for the six star markings on his forehead) as he embarks on a journey through the oceans, trying to figure out the whereabouts of his group (who were sucked up in a mysterious waterspout) while helping fellow dolphins along the way.Along with its unconventional gameplay mechanics (including a dedicated "sing" button for interaction and echolocation), the game is known for its extreme level of difficulty (which would be a staple for the main games of the series) and bizarre plot development (including time travel and alien abductions). It would later spawn a sequel (Ecco: The Tides of Time), a kid-friendly spin-off (Ecco Jr.), and a 3D reboot (Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future).Along with downscaled ports to the Sega Master System and Game Gear, the game was ported to the Sega CD less than a year later. This version (known in Japan as Ecco the Dolphin CD) features a bonus set of levels and new soundtrack (using Redbook audio), and was later ported to the PC in Japan and North America (both in 1996, featuring new high-resolution sprites). The original game was digitally re-released for the Wii (via Virtual Console on November 27, 2006), Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade on August 15, 2007), PC (via Steam on June 1, 2010), and most iOS devices (on July 22, 2010), and was included in two compilations: Sega Genesis Collection (for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable), and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3).An enhanced port was made for the Nintendo 3DS (as 3D Ecco the Dolphin, part of Sega's 3D Classics remake series) and digitally released on the 3DS eShop on December 12, 2013 (June 26, 2013 in Japan). This version features stereoscopic 3D and a significantly-easier difficulty setting (adding invulnerability and unlimited air).[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Soulstar for the Sega CD/Mega CD is a 3D shoot-'em up that combines several different types of gameplay into one game.  Some levels in this game are on a fixed path, similar to Space Harrier or Star Fox. Other levels allow your space craft to hover freely around a 3D environment, and in other levels your craft transforms into a walker robot for close-up attacks.[CR]In Soulstar the player takes the role of a warrior pilot known as Bryk Hammelt.  It is your mission to prevent an alien aggressor known as the Myrkoids from draining the Soulstar system of its energy resources.</plot>

				<title_clean>Space Ace</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Ace is Don Bluth's less-successful follow up to Dragon's Lair. Much of the same development team from Dragon's Lair worked on Space Ace, and the arcade cabinet utilized the same Laserdisc technology. For Space Ace, Bluth set out to push the Laserdisc technology beyond what he had previously showcased in Dragon's Lair, primarily by making greater use of its random-access abilities to create numerous branching pathways. Instead of building one linear sequence, and killing the player if they missed an action, the game could often incorporate a "miss" into its narrative and continue on.Just as was tried with the randomization of sequences in Dragon's Lair, the idea was that a player could have a different experience on the second, third, or even tenth play - in this case, checking out content they missed in the previous play. Space Ace was also designed to have a greater emphasis on story and characterization. To this point, unlike in Dragon's Lair, all the scenes happen in a specific order, with the occasional branching opportunities appearing within. This was done to address the "collection of disjointed scenes" criticism of Dragon's Lair.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Kimberly and Ace.The player controls the titular Space Ace on the trail of an evil alien mastermind named Borf. Borf has developed a new weapon, the "Infanto Ray", which he intends to use to enslave the population of Earth. While scouting Borf's space station, Ace's gal, Kimberly, is kidnapped and Ace himself is hit with the Infanto Ray. The ray transforms him into a lanky kid named Dexter, and leaves him in a state of fluctuating between these two forms.The player must fly, shoot, and dodge their way through Borf's lair, save Kimberly, reverse the effects of the Infanto Ray, and put a stop to Borf's plans for good.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is essentially identical to what was introduced in Dragon's Lair. The player has a joystick to select directions, and a "Shoot" button to perform actions. Animation plays up to a decision point, at which time the player has a second or less to react before the game will branch to a new path, or Ace will lose a life.Sections of the animation will quickly flash yellow to indicate both when and how the player should react. If a door on the left flashes, the player should flick the stick left to travel through the door. The action Ace will take after a successful move is often unpredictable, with the intention being that Ace's antics will surprise and entertain the player. If the player misses an action that results in death, they lose a life from their stock of 3 and must restart at the beginning of that section.Space Ace's main hook is its transforming protagonist. The player defaults to Dexter, whose cannot use a weapon, and whose sections are therefore based around dodging and avoiding hazards. Numerous times throughout the adventure, the player will get the option to "Energize". If they press the Shoot button in time, Dexter will transform into Ace, a muscular hero who can use his laser pistol to blast through enemies. Due to the branching pathway technology, if the player does not transform into Ace, they will often continue on an altered path as Dexter.Space Ace also introduced difficulty levels (Cadet, Captain, and Ace) whereas Dragon's Lair had only one. The difficulty levels were intended to make the game accessible to a wider audience, however, this was achieved by simply skipping over the more difficult sections. Nearly half the available scenes are playable on Cadet, and roughly 2/3rds on Captain, forcing players to master the Ace difficulty to see all the content.[CR]Presentation[CR]As with Dragon's Lair, hand-drawn cell animation was used running at 24 frames a second - the same as with an animated feature film. Colors were vibrant and detail unsurpassed by anything standard arcade hardware (or computers) could generate or display. A few of the sequences used models for rotoscoping, namely the spaceships, motorcycle, and tunnel and rocket skates scenes.Dragon's Lair's Chris Stone provided the soundtrack, this time more theatrical, continuous, and now recorded and presented in stereo. Space Ace features more dialogue than Dragon's Lair, so Bluth's studio did look for professional voice talent. In the end, to save money, they decided again to pull voices from within the studio. The sole professional voice talent is Michael Rye, reprising his role from Dragon's Lair as the game's narrator.Space Ace - Jeff Etter (animator)Dexter - Will Finn (animator/story)Kimberley - Lorna Pomeroy (animator)Borf - Don Bluth[CR]Versions[CR]Atari ST version.Initial ports were for home computers, and shipped on multiple floppy disks. The Laserdisc's cell animation was redrawn with less detail into computer sprites, and many levels reworked or redesigned to accommodate the hardware. Cutscenes were removed due to space limitations, so nearly all sequences cut sharply to the next, without transitions. Branching pathways are also removed, with some scenes altered and made more linear (for example, Dexter doesn't need to change to Ace to shoot the pistol).SNES versionThe SNES received the only console port of that generation, and replicated the arcade Laserdisc's vibrant colors with some success. However, gameplay is the most radically revised for this version - becoming essentially a platform title with new shooting sequences. Scenes are redesigned or invented for this version, with a focus on side-scrolling mechanics, and the player now controls Dexter/Ace fully at all times instead of making decisions at key points. Platform hopping and top-down shooting make up the basic gameplay here.Sega CD version.With the advent of CD-ROM based consoles, ports of the original Laserdisc game made the rounds with varying degrees of quality. The Sega CD release naturally featured the most compressed video, but the gameplay was largely intact. Modern releases, such as for iOS, use advanced video compression to the same effect. Digital Leisure also released a DVD version of the game, playable in most home DVD players by using the arrow keys on the remote. A similar Blu-Ray release of Space Ace and Dragon's Lair was completed in 2008.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Though Don Bluth set out to make a game that surpassed Dragon's Lair as a true showcase of animation, most arcade owners weren't impressed. Ace's increased difficulty level was cited as a problem, as was the decision to originally only offer Space Ace as a new cabinet (rather than a conversion kit). Space Ace also had the misfortune of hitting in the center of the 1983-84 video game crash, when consumer interest in the entire industry was noticeably suffering.Owners also seemed less interested in a different, but similar, game to the original Dragon's Lair as they were in an actual sequel for it. Bluth's studio would go on to put the advancements made in Ace to use in Dragon's Lair II.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Theatrical-style poster for Space Ace.Don Bluth decided to market Space Ace in a way that was new to arcade owners, but tried-and-true in the movie business - designing extensive press books and press kits to promote the game in the same way as a feature film. Theatrical movie posters were even printed up and distributed to arcade owners.The game often contradicts itself as to whether Dexter is a young Ace (and his real name), or a separate character. Kimberly occasionally calls Ace "Dexter", supporting the former, while the intro attract mode suggests Ace is trapped inside a kid's (Dexter's) body.[CR]System Requirements (Steam Release)[CR]PCMinimumOS: Windows XP SP3Processor: 1.8 GHz dual core CPUMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 256 MB GeForce 8800, Radeon 3850, or Intel HD 2000 GraphicsDirectX&#174;: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardRecommendedOS: Windows 7Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.2 GHz, or AMD Athlon 64 at 2.2 GHzMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 512 MB GeForce 220, Radeon 4550, Intel HD 3000 GraphicsDirectX&#174;: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardMacMinimumOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core Duo ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceRecommendedOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core i Series ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD space[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Star Blade</title_clean>
				<plot>StarBlade was released in arcades in 1991, developed and published by Namco. The game featured a pod, which was developed by Panasonic, in which the user played inside which had become a growing trend in arcade games. However, the inside of the pod is what StarBlade became famous for. StarBlade used a concave mirror to reflect the image from the screen to the top of the pod. This feature was meant to give a deep space feel and StarBlade was the first video game to ever implement the idea. The pod also featured surround sound with four speakers. The game was played with a large 2-axis 4-button controller that acted as a laser gun. The controller's built in LED lights flashed every time an enemy was destroyed. In contrast, when the player was hit by enemies, the seat would rumble and flashes would temporary blind the player. StarBlade was later ported to the Sega CD and 3DO, obviously without the pod. These versions used full motion video backgrounds with polygonal overlays to approximate the arcade graphics. The Sega CD version features wireframe enemies as opposed to shaded enemies. Two years later, the game was also ported to the PlayStation under the name, StarBlade Alpha. The Playstation version features an additional campaign, hence the changed title.An emulated version of the arcade game is included in Tekken 5 on the Playstation 2 as the loading screen mini-game and as a bonus feature.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Star Wars - Rebel Assault</title_clean>
				<plot>Rebel Assault was a CD-ROM showcase title for Lucasarts, making use of full motion video in both cutscenes and gameplay sections. It is essentially an on-rails shooter in that the player's only means of interaction are pointing and shooting (either with a joystick or mouse), and the occasional branching path selection.  An arcade experience is clearly what was intended, as opposed to the more sim-like aspects of the X-Wing series. The CD-ROM format also meant that the game could make use of music and sounds from the Star Wars movies to a much larger degree.  The story is original, blending elements from Episode IV and Episode V.  The player character is named Rookie One.  Rookie One is somewhat analgous to Luke Skywalker, though the story is build around various set pieces from the films.  For example, the player Pilots a Snowspeeder on Hoth, helping defend the base against Imperial Walkers (a la Empire Strikes back) but the game ends with the Death Star confrontation from A New Hope.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Star Wars Chess is a 1993 chess game developed by The Software Toolworks. It was released on PC and the Sega CD. The game is a standard chess game in which all of the pieces are represented by characters from the original Star Wars film trilogy. Similar to Battle Chess, when one piece captures another, a brief animation plays showing a battle between the two characters. Some of these battles could be particularly humorous, as it is possible for C-3PO (a light side bishop) to defeat Darth Vader (the dark side queen).[CR]Characters and Chess Pieces[CR]Light Side8 R2D2 Pawns2 C-3PO Bishops2 Yoda Rooks2 Chewbacca Knights1 Princess Leia Queen1 Luke Skywalker KingDark Side8 Imperial Stormtrooper Pawns2 Tusken Raider Bishops2 AT-ST Rooks2 Boba Fett Knights1 Darth Vader Queen1 Emperor Palpatine King [CR]</plot>

				<plot>The dreaded Draxon race has been at it again, pushing the human race around, working to either enslave all 10 billion humans or wipe them out completely. As the last surviving pilot sent on a mission to thwart the Draxons' plans, all hope rests on you. Invade each of the fortified moons orbiting the Draxons' homeworld of Arctaurus and then aim for the mother planet itself.[CR]The action takes place in your hovermorph craft. In the game's introduction, the ship proves to be a deadly starfighter. When it enters the moon's atmosphere and approaches the surface, the hovermorph transforms into a powerful hovership. Blast away Draxon enemies, both ground- and air-based, from a first-person perspective on a 3D polygonal battlefield.</plot>

				<plot>DATELINE -- 1998In the post gulf war era, there's no safe harbor. Battles are no longer contained. There are no front lines. Enemy soldiers are trained terrorists who are securely settled in the middle of civilian populations. They are ready to strike at any instant.To penetrate this inner sanctum of evil, the UN created an elite team of special forces known as SURGICAL STRIKE. With the effectiveness of a mechanized marine battalion, each unit can boast 4 highly trained specialists (including the player) with advanced recon, weapons and vehicles (attack hovercraft) specifically designed for stealth, speed and firepower in any area.  As a member of the surgical strike team, you have to be ready to ferret out of this human waste and dispose of it appropriately. `Taken straight out of the Sega CD manual`[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Heart of the Alien is the sequel to the game Out of this World, also known as Another World.  The story picks up immediately after the end of the first game.  You begin as Lester and his alien friend, "Buddy," land their pterodactyl in the ruins of Buddy's village. Lester was knocked unconscious in their escape, so Buddy lays him down on a cot to rest. The people who used to live in Buddy's village remain enslaved, so he decides to go on a mission to free them.  Thus, you control Buddy as he sets off to free the people and find a way to send Lester home.[CR]Buddy controls somewhat similarly to how Lester did in the first game. He has some new moves that are provided by his powerful energized whip.  Buddy can swing from ceiling in some instances, for example.[CR]As a bonus, this Sega CD disc includes the original Out of this World, so that you can seamlessly play both adventures as if they were one long game.</plot>

[CR]Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these worlds to collect the god's weapons.[CR]The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants) and the third is Asgard itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.[CR]When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.[CR]The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard).[CR]Once you've done this it's time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god's missing weapons.</plot>

				<plot>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.[CR]This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</plot>

				<plot>A rogue navy ship, Jeremiah Obrian, threatens to start a war. A virus has wiped out its crew, but the threat of it firing its Iron Helix doomsday weapon is still there. You must remotely pilot an unarmed science robot to explore the ship and work out how to shut the weapon down.[CR]The game uses interactive quarter-screen footage to display the ship's interiors. The main challenge is that an automated security device is chasing you down, and must be avoided and ultimately destroyed. A delay between your commands and the robot's receipt of them forces you to pay close attention to the security drone and plan several steps ahead.[CR]As you explore the ship, you will find data ports, which can be jacked into to gain information or to open doorways. To access most of these, you will need to find and collect a DNA sample from a member of staff whose role gave him/her access.</plot>

				<plot>In the early nineties, the Jaguar XJ220 was the fastest serial-produced car ever. Core Design acquired the right to build a game around it, in a move to counter Gremlin's immensely successful Lotus series.[CR]Just like Lotus, Jaguar XJ200 is a view from behind racer. There are 32 tracks all over the world, with varying road conditions and animated weather conditions such as rain and fog in England, snow in Switzerland, and tumbleweed crossing the street in Egypt. You race your Jaguar in a constructor grand prix, with opponents running for Porsche, Ferrari and other famous makers. Between races, you must mend the damage your car has sustained, which eats up your prize money. Background music is selected through a dashboard CD player, which also features some rather uninspiring radio stations.[CR]The game can also be played in a two-player split-screen mode and features a track editor for when you tire of the built-in courses.</plot>

				<plot>This is the Sega CD game based on the 1993 Steven Spielberg movie based on the book by Michael Crichton. This game differs greatly from other Jurassic Park games. It is a point-and-click adventure game, with a strong emphasis on action sequences which require split-second timing.[CR]The story takes place after the events of the movie/book. You are sent back to Jurassic Park to retrieve dinosaur eggs from around the park and put them in an incubator. You only have 12 hours to retrieve one egg from every species of dino in the park. Unfortunately, shortly before arriving at the park, your helicopter crashes!</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Samurai Shodown (known in Japan as Samurai Spirits) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on August 11, 1993.Set in the late 18th century, Samurai Shodown is known for being the first fighting game to focus on weapon-based combat and for its style of that era's Japanese culture (including calligraphy and musical instruments). The game is also known for its quirky translation, traditional control scheme, camera zoom effects (in similar vein to Art of Fighting), randomly-dropped items (including food for healing and bombs for damage), and the Rage Meter (in which receiving damage causes the fighter to temporarily become "enraged" and more powerful).Along with being one of the few Neo Geo games to receive ports to most fourth-generation game consoles, the game spawned numerous sequels and spin-off titles throughout the Neo Geo's life cycle (making it one of SNK's most well-known game series).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A typical fight, taken from the SNES version.Players face each other one-on-one, in a 2D field that can be enlarged if the fighters are far enough from each other. Unlike other fighters, however, each character fights with a weapon, ranging from swords (in fact, most characters use swords) to spears. They can also use physical attacks (there are strong/weak attack buttons for both weapons and physical attacks), but this rarely comes up. The weapons increase the range of characters' regular attacks, and if both characters attack in a precise way, they can lock weapons. When they lock weapons, each player must rapidly press buttons to win the standstill; the loser drops their weapon, while a tie results in both players losing their weapons.Also unlike other fighters, the game featured items. They included treasure (points), food (healing), and bombs (damage). A running referee would toss them into the arena at random intervals. In addition, a referee would hold up a flag whenever one of the players took a hit; he would hold up a different colored flag depending on who got hit. This referee, named Kuroko, would become a hidden character in the Game Boy port, using his flags as weapons.Samurai Shodown also featured mini-games at regular intervals throughout the single-player mode. Players had to slash through ten straw men in the span of thirty seconds. Straw men would only stay up for a short amount of time, this amount of time lessening in later iterations of the mini-game. For the most part, cutscenes took place immediately before and after the mini-game, showing Amakusa's rise to power and his revenge against the Tokugawa. There were only two exceptions, one of them being the ending for a particular character's story.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Note: this only covers characters present in the original arcade version.AmakusaThe main villain of the first Samurai Shodown game and several games afterward, Amakusa wishes to destroy the Tokugawa and gain great magical power. Unfortunately, he is not a playable character. Amakusa has one of the widest movesets in the game, being able to launch himself like a meteor, create a boomerang-esque ball of magic energy, teleport around the stage several times, and punch at his opponents rapidly.Gen-AnA green devil, Gen-An can rush at his opponents as a spinning blade-ball, climbing the wall he hits to come back down and hit them again. Gen-An can also send a ball of poison gas at his opponents, potentially disabling them temporarily if it hits. He fights his enemies with a giant steel claw he wears on his right hand.GalfordGalford and Poppy.A San Francisco swordsman, Galford is one of two characters in the game to get assistance from an animal: his dog, Poppy. Poppy is most likely a girl, since the credits reveal that she has puppies. Like Hanzo, Galford can launch projectiles at his opponents, create holograms of himself to confuse his enemies, and disappear to strike from above. He can also send Poppy to maul other fighters.JubeiLike Hanzo, Jubei is based on a famous historical figure; in this case, he is a legendary samurai. His moveset includes multiple stabs, followed by an uppercut similar to Charlotte's, and sending a shockwave along the ground to his enemies. Jubei insists that he is not that guy from Fatal Fury.UkyoA blue-haired swordsman from Japan. Ukyo can send a fire bird down while jumping, and repeatedly slash at his opponent. He signals the latter by throwing an apple, which he rapidly slashes, as well.CharlotteA French knight, Charlotte is one of two female characters in Samurai Shodown. She is sensitive about this fact, telling opponents not to mention her plate (most likely her breast plate). After defeating Amakusa, Charlotte returns to France to aid the peasants in the French Revolution. She can perform a triangle slash, drag a green column up with her while jumping, and charge at her opponents with multiple sword thrusts.Tam-TamTam-TamA Mayan warrior always seen wearing a mask. Oddly enough, he is one of the few characters with any stake in what Amakusa is doing; after beating him, he takes the orb that Amakusa used as a weapon. This orb apparently belongs to the Mayans, and Tam-Tam uses it to heal the ailments of those around him. Tam-Tam can throw skulls, summon rising demons, and spin his flaming sword while moving toward his opponent.EarthquakeBased in Texas, Earthquake is the leader of a gang of thieves searching for treasure. In fact, upon defeating Amakusa, his three subordinates return to him with piles of treasure. He is tall, fat, and missing several teeth. Earthquake can rush toward his opponent as a spinning blade ball, or bounce toward them to harm them with his butt.NakoruruAn Ainu priestess, Nakoruru is not only one of the two female characters in the first Samurai Shodown, but also one of two characters who fight with animal friends. Her hawk, Mamahaha, can lift Nakoruru into the air, allowing her to drop down and slash her opponent. She can also rush toward her opponent, either remaining on the ground or rising up to do so.Wan-FuThe King of China, Wan-Fu is the only character who can voluntarily give up their weapon. This is done by jumping into the air and tossing a flaming sword at the opponent. Usually, when the AI does this, they run toward the sword to retrieve it. Wan-Fu can also perform an uppercut with his sword.HaohmaruHaohmaru's ending.The protagonist of the Samurai Shodown series, Haohmaru is a Japanese swordsman. His moves include sending a tornado at enemies and a type of sword uppercut. After his fight with Amakusa, Haohmaru returns to Japan and fights Mai Shiranui of King of Fighters fame.HanzoA Tokugawa ninja based on a historical figure. He can send fire toward his opponents, throw shurikens, and disappear to strike from above. After defeating Amakusa, Hanzo spends his life training other ninjas.KyoshiroA kabuki actor, Kyoshiro can toss flaming fans, spin-jump at his opponents, and use his poll to thrust himself at the opponent as a fireball.[CR]Ports[CR]The SNES port of Samurai Shodown removed a lot from the arcade original, like the blood and large battlefields.After being made for the Neo Geo, Samurai Shodown was ported to many systems. However, few were capable of running the game at the technical level that the Neo Geo did. For example, the SNES, Genesis, and Sega CD versions removed the scaling present in the original; instead, they kept the characters at a constant size (the Genesis and Sega CD used the large sprites, the SNES their small counterparts). The SNES and Genesis versions also removed the blood present in the original. The port closest to the original was the 3DO version, which kept the scaling and blood that the others lacked.In addition to a playable Amakusa, the Game Boy version had two additional unlockable characters: Kuroko, the referee, and Hikyaku, the courier man that throws item onto the battlefield. Although Kuroko would also become a playable character in later games, Hikyaku has yet to resurface in that role.Samurai Shodown would also appear in later compilations alongside other Samurai Shodown games. It was ported to the PS1 along with its sequel under the name Samurai Spirits Kenkaku Shinan Pack. However, this port was only available in Japan. However, it would also appear in Samurai Shodown Anthology for the Wii, PS2 and PSP, along with its five direct sequels.Samurai Shodown, along with II and III, were also ported to the Wii's Virtual Console. All three were ports of their Neo Geo incarnations, making it unlikely that the SNES and Genesis ports of the game will be ported, as well.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Sega Classics Arcade Collection is a compilation of four (or five) Sega Mega Drive games for the Sega Mega-CD. It was a pack-in game bundled with launch Mega CDs in the United Kingdom and North America, and was released separately in other regions.[CR]Two variants of Sega Classics Arcade Collection exist; an earlier version seen in North America and Japan, which contains Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Columns and The Revenge of Shinobi, and a later version seen in Europe and later North American bundles, which throws in Super Monaco GP. In North America the older "4-in-1" variant came in the same box as Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective Vol. I, while the later "5-in-1" one came with Ecco the Dolphin.[CR]Each game is mostly identical to their Mega Drive counterparts, though have minor changes thanks to the Mega CD's enhancements. All digitised speech samples have been replaced with higher quality audio, the first level in Golden Axe uses different instruments and Super Monaco GP has extra drums. The Revenge of Shinobi is based on a later version than its cartridge counterparts, altering some of the bosses which infringe copyrights. For unknown reasons, Golden Axe is only a one-player game in this compilation.[CR]Despite being the Mega CD's selling point, only two games have an updated CD soundtrack (Golden Axe in the form of music recorded from its arcade board, and Columns which has a new title theme). This means only a small fraction of the disc is used.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Set in the not-too-distant future, humanity has been forced to live in their underground infrastructures for unspecified reasons. Here, bands of "Sewer Jockies" group together and with the use of their armed ships, scour the tunnel systems in order to exterminate the mutated creatures that inhabit the sewers to prevent them from contaminating the above-ground resort area of Solar City.The player assumes the role of a rookie pilot and is joined by a veteran pilot, Ghost, who proceeds to berate the player for the majority of the game, and his robot scout, Catfish, who provides the player with valuable information. Throughout the game, the player receives transmissions from the owner of Solar City, Commissioner Stenchler, who will allow the player into his resort should they kill one million pounds worth of creatures.Meanwhile, a fellow jockey by the name of Falco rides into unsanctioned territory following what she describes as a "crazy looking thing," thinking it will lead her on a secret path to Solar City. Later, this creature provides the route for players as opposed to receiving this information from Catfish.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As a rail shooter, the player does not take direct control of the ship, but that of the targeting crosshair in order to shoot the various species as they appear. The player does, however, have limited control of the ship during specific navigation spots. While the directions are always different, there is only one specific route to through the sewer for each time the game is played, as specified by Catfish. Occasionally, Catfish will give the player a series of directions (3, 6, 9 or 12) which must be followed or the game will end. When approaching one of the navigation spots, the player must hold down the A button and press the appropriate direction.[CR]Original Format[CR]Originally filmed and created in 1987, Sewer Shark was one of a few games, including eventual Sega CD hit Night Trap, developed for an interactive video system called Nemo, created by Tom Zito for Hasbro. When Hasbro canceled the Nemo project, Zito purchased the rights for Night Trap and Sewer Shark back from Hasbro with the hope that they would one day see release.Years later, Sony would be developing a CD-based addon for Super Nintendo, dubbed Playstation. In search of pre-existing FMV-based games to port to the new system, members of Sony discovered Sewer Shark and wished to license it for the Nintendo Playstation. In response, Tom Zito founded Digital Pictures and worked to port Sewer Shark and Night Trap to the Nintendo add-on, as well as develop all-new FMV-based games.When Sony's development deal for the Super Nintendo add-on fell apart, Sony struck up a partnership with Sega to release the games for the upcoming Sega Genesis CD add-on, Sega CD, instead. Tom Zito would later express minor disappointment with the change, as the Sega Genesis' limitation of only showing 64 colors on screen at one time severely degraded the video quality over the Super Nintendo, which was capable of displaying up to 256 colors on screen at once.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.[CR]Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Flashback: The Quest for Identity is a 2D action-adventure platform game originally developed by Delphine Software International and published by U.S. Gold for Commodore Amiga home computers in 1992. The game stars plucky protagonist Conrad B. Hart, a young man stricken with total amnesia who finds himself stranded deep in the jungles of an alien world. Similar to Delphine's earlier title Out of This World, Flashback is notable for its use of rotoscoped animation, allowing for a visually fluid representation of the characters' various movements.The game was first released on floppy diskette for the Amiga, a home computer popular in Delphine's native France; it was eventually ported to MS-DOS, Super NES, Genesis, Atari Jaguar and the Acorn Archimedes the following year. A CD-ROM version was later released for MS-DOS, Sega CD, CD-i, 3DO and FM Towns in 1994. Many of Flashback's ports were developed wholly or in part by Tiertex Design Studios.Flashback: The Quest for Identity was followed by its 1995 sequel Fade to Black. The original game was remade in 2013 with full 3D graphics and was released simply as Flashback with no subtitle.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game opens in medias res as protagonist Conrad B. Hart flees down a corridor from a pair of men armed with laser weapons. Conrad jumps onto a hoverbike and temporarily evades his assailants; however, a much larger transport soon gives chase and quickly blasts Conrad's vehicle out of the sky. After a brief search of the crash area, the armed transport flies off, leaving Conrad for dead in the depths of an unknown jungle.AmnesiaFlashback features rotoscoped cutscenes.Conrad awakens the next day in an alien jungle on a planet known as Titan. It becomes apparent he has no memory of events prior to the chase. Upon awakening he notices that he knocked a cube-shaped object off a ledge and sets out to retrieve it. The cube contains a message recorded by the protagonist before he lost his memory. He gives no clues as to what has happened but tells him to seek out his friend Ian who is located in New Washington. Conrad then proceeds to take on the dangers of this jungle to find Ian. After battling enemies in the form of robots and mutants with other obstacles such as turrets and strange fires Conrad eventually comes across a hole in the ground that acts as an entrance to New Washington. An old man who sits near this hole trades an Anti-G Belt that negates the effects of gravity to some extent, for some credits allowing Conrad access to his next location.A short while after arriving in New Washington Conrad discovers Ian being held by a couple of New Washington Police Officers. After battling these men off Ian places Conrad in a machine that recovers his memories. It is revealed that Conrad had discovered a race of aliens was blending in with the human population on Earth in large quantity implying an eventual take over of the planet. His revelation had caught the attention of this alien race who would try to assassinate him. After they failed the first time it prompted Conrad to record the Holo-Cube message found earlier in the game and to send a copy of his memories to Ian. The game's manual would also explain that the alien race is called Morphs and killed Conrad's girlfriend. One night the aliens finally captured Conrad and took him aboard their ship. On this night they erased his memory but failed to secure him as Conrad would awaken and flee his captures, leading to what was witnessed at the beginning of the game.EmploymentWith his memories restored Conrad decides he needs to return to Earth. With little money however, this was never going to be as easy as it sounds. Ian suggests that Conrad should take part in a TV Show where he must fight Cyborgs for a chance to win a ticket to Earth. As it would be too dangerous to compete under his own name Conrad has to get false ID papers. Ian sends him to a contact named Jack, who demands 1,500 credits for the papers. Since he doesn't have that sort of cash on hand Conrad partakes in multiple odd jobs available in New Washington.First he is hired by Titan Spaces Lines for an apparently easy job of collecting and delivering a parcel. Just outsides the parcels destination he is attacked by a member of the NWPD but overcomes him and delivers the package.The second mission comes from Virtual Crop that requests Conrad escort a VIP to their research center. It is made clear that the mission will require a firearm ad the area traveled in will be dangerous. The warning is well advised since mutants infest the area in addition to malfunctioning Security Spheres. Like previously though Conrad succeeds.Titan TV hires Conrad for the third mission. They report that a Model Cy-Borg 2.1 has escaped with the possible assistance of an outsider. It carries a virus which could spread to all other functioning cyborgs. A police officer informs Conrad that the Cy-Borg wants to make a deal. This turns out to be a trap however and Conrad kills the Police Officer for access to 2.1&#8217;s lair. Once in his hideout Conrad eliminates 2.1.The penultimate New Washington mission is accomplished for Titan Senior Advisory Board. Sabotage to the generator that supplies power to New Washington means the city is on the verge of blowing up. Conrad has 90 seconds to locate the sabotaged area and repair it. With only seconds left Conrad repairs the generator and saves New Washington.With only one mission required to gain the necessary credits for the false papers, another party hires Conrad to eliminate the mutant threat that is lurking in all the Restricted Areas. After accomplishing this task Conrad meets Jack one more time who now hands over the papers allowing entry into the game show.The game show of requires participants to fight their way through eight different levels of deadly situations. Littered throughout every level are Cy-Borg 2.1s, Sentry Spheres and mines. Conrad manages to fight through all levels and win a ticket to Earth.Back on EarthEarthConrad believes The Morphs have a hidden base within a night club on Earth but upon arrival is attacked by the local law enforcement and security measures. After some time he locates the nightclub. He breaks in through an upper level thus causing more security measures to become active making his job of finding the Morphs more complicated.After much tribulation Conrad finds himself in a vent shaft above a group of Morphs that are discussing their plans. They reveal that soon their invasion will begin since millions of their kind are ready to teleport in and destroy humanity. Conrad&#8217;s vent then proceeds to collapse under his weight and he is discovered. It is decided that he will be thrown into the dungeon with plans for interrogation.After he wakes up in his cell Conrad discovers he is unarmed and that Cy-Borgs have been sent to his cell to carry out the interrogation. Unexpectedly though Conrad makes a quick burst for the door and evades the Cy-Borgs. Luckily enough his gun was not too far away and he is able to destroy his would-be interrogators. Further into their lair Conrad finally confronts the Morphs in combat. With their ability to take and lose shape whenever they want Conrad has a difficult time but overcomes everyone he meets. With the realization that the Morph invasion is close with no time to report it, Conrad teleports to the Morph home planet with the intention of stopping their conquest.On the planet Conrad tries to assist a human prisoner who is in possession of explosives. Unfortunately the man is killed by a Morph upon his release but lives long enough to give Conrad the destructive device. Conrad discovers a diary on the planet that reveals a captive human scientist managed to enter the theory of molecular research into a Titan computer. This theory was taken up by Conrad who made glasses revealing the aliens living among the human population. It is also revealed that The Master Brain, positions at the center of the planet, controls all morphs, destroying him will end the race. The device Conrad holds was created by the scientist and is powerful enough to destroy the entire planet.With other options being non-existent, Conrad decides to put the scientist's plan into action. He travels all the way into the planet&#8217;s core. After battling more Morphs the Master Brain is killed. After dropping the Atomic Charge into the foundations of the planet Conrad races against time to escape the planet in a docked ship before the planet explodes.Conrad only just makes it, with the ship just out of reach from the destructive force of the Atomic Device. Conrad soon learns though that he is in a galaxy unrecognized by the ship&#8217;s systems. With the possibility of being lost in space forever Conrad places himself in cryogenic suspension to be awakened if he is ever discovered.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Genesis version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 9,9,9,8 in addition to the Editor's Choice Gold award. They added, "...one of the best games ever made for the Genesis. The action is non-stop, and it really feels like you're playing a movie!...get a joystick, because the generic Sega controllers aren't precise enough to handle the diagonal motions necessary for some of the specialized techniques".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Misadventures of Flink is a Jump'n Run set in the fantasy world of Imagica. The evil wizard Wicked Wainwright has captured the four elders and it is up to Flink, a wizard's apprentice, to set them free and defeat Wicked Wainwright.[CR]Apart from the usual platformer elements, the game has a unique feature: Flink's ability to create spells. Whenever the game is paused, Flink can combine three ingredients to create a spell. Ingredients can be collected throughout the game. They are usually carried around by a certain type of enemy or hidden in treasure chests. There are ten different spells, the "recipes" which are contained in scrolls that are given to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain levels. The spells include different attack spells (for example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic keys that open locked treasure chests and more. [CR]Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic bottles or defeating enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, when Flink is hit, he looses all of his magic energy and has only limited time to pick it up again. If he is hit while having no magic energy, he loses a life.</plot>

				<title_clean>Formula One World Championship - Beyond The Limit</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Formula One World Championship: Beyond the Limit is a F1 racing game that was developed by Fuji Television Network and published by Sega sometime in 1994. The game follows the 1993 F1 season, with every race accounted for and the majority of the drivers playable. The game was released in Japan as Heavenly Symphony: Formula One World Championship 1993.[CR]The Game[CR]There are three modes in the game; Grand Prix, 1993 Mode and Free Run.In Grand Prix mode you follow a story line and meet with all the actual people who own, design and race the cars. Your first race here is a qualification race to see which teams want to recruit you. After you select which team you wish to race for you meet with the people who make that team work, learn a bit about the company and then head out to race with story bits cut in after each race to clue you in on the behind the scenes rivalries and drama.In 1993 Mode you follow along the 1993 Formula Season and the game then acts as a semi-documentary interlacing levels with FMV, giving the stats on each race and any unique events that happened during the race. You control a set character and then accomplish tasks that happened during the actual race. For the South African Grand Prix you play as JJ Lehto trying to catch up to Derek Warwick in the middle of a thunderstorm.Free Race mode is exactly as it sounds. You decide which track to race, how many laps and the weather conditions.[CR][B]Teams:[/B][CR]Williams FW 15C#0 Damon Hill#2 Alain ProstTyrrell 020C#3 Ukyo Katayama#4 Andrea de CesarisBenetton B193B#5 Michael Schumacher#6 Riccardo PatreseMcLaren MP4/8#7 Michael Andretti#_ Your CharacterFootwork FA14#9 Derek Warwick#10 Aguri SuzukiLotus 107B#11 Alex Zanardi#12 Johnny HerbertJordan 193#14 Rubens Barrichello#15 Ivan CapelliLarrousse LH93#19 Phillippe Alliot#20 Erik ComasLola-BMS- T93/30#21 Michele Alboreto#22 Luca BadoerMinardi M193#23 Christian Fittipaldi#24 Fabrizio BarbazzaLigier JS39#25 Martin Brundle#26 Mark BlundellFerrari F93A#27 Jean Alesi#28 Gerhard BergerSauber C12#29 Karl Wendlinger#30 JJ Lehto[CR]One Missing Driver[CR]It's worth noting that the missing driver in the roster (the second McLaren car) was Ayrton Senna. Ironic considering Sega's previous F1 game was Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II, not to mention this game was released in the same year that Senna died at Imola.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battlecorps was developed by Core Design for the Sega CD. It was published by Time Warner Interactive in the United States, Core Design in Europe and by Victor Interactive Software in Japan. The game is played from the first-person perspective and you are the pilot of a walking mech.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Corporate Wars have begun with weapons powered by the new turbo-breeder, "Super Fission" reactors. Burning with a cold dark flame at the core of these reactors is the rare, extraterrestrial element, "Meridium", which was discovered by the Interplanetary Mining Corporation (IMC) on a misbegotten planet known as "Mandlebrot's World", located eight light years from Earth. A colony is soon established on Mandlebrot and it's manned by a small team of miners using the latest robotics mining and defense machines - the Battlebots. But when MOSES (Multicameral Organic Synergistic Energized System), the colony's bio-computerized operating system, is infected with a virus by a saboteur from a rival mining company, BioMechanical Incorporated (BioMech), all hell breaks loose. MOSES turns the Battlebots on the colonists. The Battlebots imprison the colonists and transform Mandlebrot into a heavily armed fortress. IMC immediately dispatches the BATTLECORPS combat-hardened veterans of the Corporate Wars. These veterans are downloaded into their Armordillo-Class, Bipedal Attack Machines (BAMs) and they must now take back the planet...[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Bill Walsh College Football</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bill Walsh College Football is a 1993 college football game for the Super Nintendo, Sega CD and Genesis. It is functionally similar to EA Sports's more famous football series, Madden NFL, and contains many similar features. The player can select to play a single exhibition game, start a whole season, take part in the '93 playoffs or play famous playoffs with historical teams. The latter two modes have set team ups.Featured TeamsAlabamaArizonaBoston (Massachusetts) College Station (Texas)ColoradoColumbus (Ohio)FloridaGeorgiaHawaiiKansasMiami (Florida)MichiganNebraskaProvo (Utah)Pullman (Washington)Raleigh (North Carolina)South CarolinaSouth Bend (Indiana)Stanford (California)State College (Pennsylvania)Syracuse (New York)Tallahassee (Florida)TennesseeWashingtonIt also includes the following "historical" teams:Alabama '78Atlanta '90 (Georgia)Auburn '83 (Alabama)Baton Rouge '87 (Louisiana)Boston '84Clemson '81 (South Carolina)Colorado '90Columbus '79Florida '84Georgia '80Los Angeles '82 (California)Miami '91Michigan '85Nebraska '83Oklahoma '85Pittsburgh '80 (Pennsylvania)Provo '84South Carolina '79South Bend '88State College '86Tallahassee '87Tennessee '85Texas '81Washington '91[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand gave the review score of 7 out of ten writing, "...the idea of making this with college football teams is almost irrelevant, since it is almost identical to all other football games out there". Later in the two sentence review he appears to contradict himself when he adds, "...game play is solid, just as you would expect from EA, making it a must for football fans".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>According to Blackhole Assault, the 22nd century sees earth technology advance to the point where exploration of the immediate solar system is not only possible, but necessary due to resource constraints. Humans are attempting to harvest the resources of the entire solar system but have met with trouble from alien invaders. It is up to a small force of humans who recognize and understand the threat to confront the aliens head on.[CR]The weapon of choice in this game is the Cybernetic Anthropomorphized Machine, or C.A.M. The C.A.M. is a large robot that fights 1-on-1 against alien robots. All of the gameplay in Blackhole Assault revolves around single-round, 1-on-1 robot fighting action. There are 10 backdrops against which to beat up robots, including various planets and moons around the solar system.[CR]The game has 4 different modes. The main story mode is Operation BHA. The exhibition mode allows players to customize matches down to the robots each player will use and the backdrop to play on. The exhibition mode can be configured to allow one or even both fighters to be controlled by the computer. Further, the game has tournament and league modes.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bram Stoker's Dracula is a 1993 video game released as a tie-in based on the Francis Ford Coppola movie of the same name. In the game, the player takes on the role of Jonathan Harker, who must stop the vampire Dracula. Versions of the game were released for a multitude of platforms ranging from the Amiga and NES to the Sega CD and PC.There were numerous variations between each version, though they all played similarly and shared the protagonist Jonathan Harker.NES, Game Boy, Game Gear and Sega Master SystemThe 8-bit and portable versions of the game skewed closer to standard platformers than the other console versions, with floating platforms and other standard platformer obstacles.SNES and GenesisThe 16-bit versions were action games that focused more on combat and adventure game elements than platforming. The sprite used for Harker was larger, and the games had more enemies to face down.Sega CD and AmigaSimilar to the SNES and Genesis, these versions were more action-oriented. They included FMV cutscenes from the movie and digitized backgrounds.DOSThe Bram Stoker's Dracula for PC MS-DOS systems was a first-person shooter, taking after games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D (or Blood and Heretic, which share similar gothic horror settings).[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Dalai Llama (bad pun or what?) has organised a martial arts contest for animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself. [CR]Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat 'em up across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown. [CR]During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a "taunt" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen. [CR]Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player. [CR]The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.[CR]In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though.</plot>

				<plot>A third-person driving and shooting game, based on a popular "alternative" comic series by Mark Shultz. The game is a rail-shooter, similar to Rocket Science's earliest game Loadstar.[CR]You find yourself in the so-called Xenozoic Age - after a cataclysm in 2020 A.D., mankind was forced to hide beneath the surface. Once it could come out again, it found the world terribly changed, with dinosaurs roaming freely once again. A mysterious mutant-like race, called the Grith, believe the cataclysm was caused by the upsetting of the natural balance. Now, the leader of the restored City in the Sea, Scharnhorst, is using old technology and disrupting the balance again. The Girth chose you, Jack Tenrec, and your partner Hannah Dundee, to rid the world of Scharnhorst. And you get to do it in a red '53 Cadillac with mounted machine guns.[CR]While you're at the task, you must battle hungry, mean dinosaurs, but also be careful not to upset the balance of nature. Also, try not to upset your volcanic-energy fueled caddy by hitting too much obstacles along the way.[CR]Graphics are a mix of 3D objects and environments and comic-like 2D sprites, but captures much of the original comic book's style.</plot>

				<plot>The first football (soccer to you Americans; how come your game called football features virtually no kicks, and even then only from 2 designated players?) game to challenge the supremacy of the Kick Off series. The graphical view is from a distance overhead, making the players small on screen but making around half the pitch visible. [CR]The basic control system involves loose control, making running with the ball (dribbling in football parlance) a skill to master, and putting the emphasis on  one-touch passing, which can be easily performed by tapping the fire button.[CR]The game features customisable league and cup competitions as well as pre-set ones including the 1992 European Championships. There are 168 teams in total, 40 European nations, the 64 top club sides, and 64 custom teams with names ranging from self-indulgent to comical, and their details are fully editable. At club and country level, each team has 3 star players who are more gifted that the others, use them wisely.</plot>

				<plot>The story in this Chuck Rock game takes up a little while after the end of the first game.  As you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter.  Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married.  Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him.  Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad![CR]The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.</plot>

				<title_clean>Chuck Rock</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chuck Rock is a prehistoric-themed platformer starring the eponymous caveman Chuck on a quest to rescue his wife from a jealous rival. Chuck's main form of attack is a stomach bump with a limited range, but he is also able to take advantage of rocks littering the stages to attack enemies from afar. He can also use these rocks to create platforms to higher areas he cannot reach by jumping normally. While most dinosaurs are hostile some, like the wading brachiosaurs and certain pteranodons, will assist Chuck by taking him to new areas of the stage.UK developers Core Design originally created Chuck Rock for the Atari ST and Amiga computer platforms, and it was subsequently published on many home consoles of the era by Sony Imagesoft and Virgin Interactive in Europe and the US. It is perhaps best remembered for its rock n' roll theme tune. It was followed up with a direct sequel starring Chuck's son Chuck Jr., called Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, and BC Racers, a spin-off cart racer game.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the Stallone film of the same name. Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from avalanches. [CR]Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.[CR]The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.</plot>

				<plot>StoryThe game begins with the main hero - a soldier landing on a strange island. His parachute gets stuck on a tree. While trying to get down he is attacked and bitten by a zombie. The hero is then rescued by Rastafarian that becomes your guide on the island. Using transceiver he finds that his comrades were captured and massacred by a crazy scientist creating a zombie-solider arny. the original mission was to stop him but the goal quickly turns to that of survival. The hero is slowly turning into zombie and the only way of survival is finding an antidote.GameplayUnlike much of Digital Pictures's lineup the movie and the gameplay are not synonymous. Rather there are clear "gameplay" sections as well as video segments. The "gameplay" portion of the game consists of a scrolling scene where players must shoot zombies before they reach them.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>3 Ninjas Kick Back</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]3 Ninjas Kick Back is a 1994 action-platformer game for the Super Nintendo,  Sega Genesis and Sega CD. The player, as either Rocky (the green-garbed older brother, who uses a staff in-game), Colt (the blue-garbed middle brother, who uses a sword in-game) or Tum Tum (the yellow-garbed youngest brother, who uses a pair of sais), must make their way through a series of levels using their speed, reflexes and ninja skills. The game emphasizes climbing as a mechanic, allowing the player character to hold onto branches and swinging vines by holding up while jumping. From these vantage points, the player can progress in the stage or find hidden bonuses.3 Ninjas Kick Back is based on the 1994 movie of the same name, which was the second 3 Ninjas movie to be released. The plot concerns the theft of a dagger that was awarded to the trio's grandfather, Mori, for winning a tournament in Japan 50 years ago. The trio eventually head to Japan to track it down, fighting the goons of Koga (an embittered runner-up in the tournament) along the way.The Sega CD version of the game was bundled together with the 1992 SNES/Genesis licensed platformer Hook, which was also based on a family movie distributed by TriStar Pictures.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In the year 2500, humanity is attacked by the alien Gurzons. The Earth Defense Force doesn't stand a chance, and whole cities are laid to waste by the evil invaders. There is still hope, however: enemies of the Gurzons from the planet Prism offer their help. If just a few EDF pilots can make it to Prism, they will be provided with the ultimate weapon which may turn the tide: the A/X 101 system. Controlling one of four starfighters launched on the mission, it is the player's job to break the orbital blockade, make it to Prism and then take the fight to the enemy.[CR]The game is an on-rails shooter, with gameplay seen from a first-person cockpit perspective. The player's ship moves automatically through pre-rendered space and planetary environments and only the targeting crosshair can be moved freely. Laser Cannons and Fusion Warheads are available to hit the numerous enemies. Lasers have unlimited ammunition but need a few moments time to recharge. The warheads function as smart bombs and clear the screen of enemies, but are available only in limited supply. They are restocked when reaching a certain score. The ship's energy shield functions as a life bar.[CR]Between the shooting levels, there are transitional cutscenes, pre-rendered in the same way as the actual gameplay.</plot>

				<title_clean>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Eye Of The Beholder</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Eye of the Beholder (EotB) is the first game in the  AD&amp;D-based  Eye of the Beholder trilogy published by SSI as a part of their "Legend Series." It was developed by Westwood Associates, the same developers that would go on to become Westwood Studios, and published by SSI. It was notable at the time for its use of lush 3D graphics, extensive puzzles, and animated monster encounters along with the degree of interactivity that players had within its dungeons such as flipping levers, weighing down pressure plates with stones, and its real-time interface. The game pits a party of adventurers against the machinations of a beholder known as Xanathar: a ruthless criminal hiding deep beneath the port city of Waterdeep.The game is a licensed TSR product, and implements the  2nd Edition AD&amp;D ruleset and features the  Forgotten Realms campaign setting that had been used in previous SSI AD&amp;D games such as the Gold Box series. In the Forgotten Realms setting, Waterdeep is one of the greatest cities of the era, the so-called "Crown of the North," a vital trading hub whose wealth has seen its environs and its influence expand rapidly throughout the Sword Coast region. The secretive Lords of Waterdeep, the unseen council that both watches and protects the city from fell schemes discovered outside and within its own walls, maintain the tenuous balance of power between the factions there in order to ensure its survival. Only one of these Lords is ever shown as the "public" face in order to act as a liaison between the people and themselves.Copy protection takes the form of challenge questions that the player will occasionally be asked during the course of the game that would refer to a specific word within the game manual. Copies were encouraged in order to preserve the original disks. The console versions did not include this aspect.The manual is also notable for including a great deal of information concerning the monsters, classes, and weapons that could be encountered within the game, all adhering to the 2nd Edition AD&amp;D ruleset. Experience tables and other pieces of information are located in the back of the manual. The following manuals would be similar in design, although the monsters described would be changed from one title to the next. The manual for Eye of the Beholder also contains a rough map of Waterdeep as well as a historical primer on its significance.The game was ported to consoles in 1994, including a  SNES version by  Capcom and a  Sega CD version by  Sega. While Capcom's version is a more faithful reproduction of the original, the Sega CD version was an enhanced  remake famous for its CD soundtrack composed by  Yuzo Koshiro. Departing from the  chiptune medieval music of the the original PC version, Koshiro's Sega CD soundtrack was one of the first  ambient  electronica soundtracks.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Eye of the Beholder's story begins with a meeting called by Piergeiron, the current Lord of Waterdeep, with the party. He hands them a letter describing a threat that his friend, the Archmage, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, has detected witin the city and requests that the party investigate the disturbances and, if necessary, deal with them in whatever method they see fit. They are given an official commission from the city and are quickly ushered to the sewers where they believe the threat to be located. However, their unseen nemesis has been waiting for them and the only way out is suddenly blocked by a thundering avalanche of rocks and stone, forcing the player to delve deeper below the streets of Waterdeep and to a confrontation with their foe.After a series of traps and challenges that the party encounters during the adventure, they come face to face with Xanathar, a beholder who is also acting as the major crime lord of Waterdeep who has been plotting his ascension to power. After a climactic battle in which Xanatar is defeated, the party is celebrated as heroes of the city.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game uses a  grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90&#176; turns and movement spaces. Within the ever-present interface, a small window on the upper left quadrant of the screen displayed the world as in the first with the party listed on the right. A text box on the bottom part of the screen displays various messages while a compass is also shown when outside of combat. Random enemy encounters provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes. Everything in the interface is mouse-driven.Party setup and character selection are left entirely up to the player and many of the mechanisms and options available would remain unchanged through the next two iterations of the series. The party would always remain limited to six characters.RacesSix races are available for players to choose from and would be the first step in creating a new batch of characters. Gender has no bearing on a character's performance aside from making available the appropriate portraits during character creation. Many of the steps utilized in this part of the game would continue to act as the standard setup throughout the series.In keeping with the 2nd Edition AD&amp;D ruleset, each race has its own set of restrictions concerning both what classes are available to them such as how far they can advance in certain ones. Racial modifiers can also affect their efficiency in certain professions. Human: As in most RPGs, their statistics and abilities are fairly average across the board with no distinctive bonuses.Elf: Fair haired, fair skinned, and more agile than humans, their specialties are focused on both magic and war although they tend to do better as spellcasters. They have a bonus to dexterity and the use of bows along with long or short swords. They are highly resistant to charm or sleep spells. Dwarf: Short, gruff, and strong, they are renowned for their smithing skills as well as their combat abilities. Being a somewhat non-magical race, they have good resistances against many spells and even poisons. Halflings: Short in stature, friendly to a fault, and generally good natured, halflings are also innately resistant to spells. They're also dexterous making them decent fighters and sticky fingered rogues.Half Elves: They have no racial modifiers but are somewhat resistant to sleep and charm spells. However, because of their longer lifespans, they are able to multi-class with a greater number of combinations than other races and are decent fighters. Gnome: Good as clerics, thieves, and even fighters, they are also fairly magic resistant as their distant cousins, the dwarves, are.ClassesAs with many RPGs, the game offers a choice to the player to select from a variety of classes that they could use to first create their characters and, ultimately, their parties with.Throughout the entire  Eye of the Beholder series, six  classes would be made available to players to choose from, each with its own set of restrictions, although certain races have the ability to multi-class meaning that they can become a combination of classes. Each classes require certain prime requisites, or ability scores, to be at certain values before that character can become part of that class.Fighter: The consummate fighter, they can use nearly every weapon that they find. They can use magical weapons, rings, but can cast no spells. As they gain levels, they also gain speed which enables them to attack more often in combat. The prime requisite for this class is strength and any race and alignment can be a member.Paladin: These are elite fighters dedicated to smiting evil wherever it may be and will not join a party that has evil members. They are immune to disease, have increased resistances to spell effects and poison, and can heal other characters with their "laying on of hands" ability. At higher levels, they are also able to turn undead and can cast certain clerical spells. They also have a persistent aura around them that acts as a negative affect on evil creatures that come too close. Only humans with good scores in both Strength and Charisma can become this class.Thieves: A high dexterity is a prime requisite for this class and they are restricted in wearing only leather-type armor and in using a limited number of weapons. Any race can be this class and it is considered an important one to have in the game to avoid getting the party killed whenever a trap is found.Rangers: They can use any weapon as a fighter can and can even dual wield melee weapons without any penalty, but only if they are not wearing heavy armor. Humans, elves, and half-elves are the only races that are allowed in the game that can be a part of this class.Cleric: They are holy warriors that can fight with a number of weapons and wear armor while casting divine spells against their enemies. Ideal for dealing with the undead as well as healing the party. Wisdom is the prime requisite for this class and any race can be a part of it.Mages: The spellcasters of the Realm, what they lack in armor and weapons expertise are made up for in the spells that they can weave. Unlike several other RPG systems of the time that utilized spell points, mages in AD&amp;D have to memorize a set number of spells in order to store and use them at a later time. Once those memorized spells are used up, the mage must take time to memorize another batch. Intelligence is the prime requisite for this class and as they gain in level, they also gain extra slots that can be used to store memorized spells. Humans, Elves, and Half-Elves can become mages in the game.AlignmentAD&amp;D along with many other PnP RPGs at the time makes extensive use of an  alignment system to determine a character's worldview and how they conduct themselves within society which would also be reflected in EotB's mechanics as well as that of its following sequels.World View:Lawful: A character will work within the lawsNeutral: A character will move between valuing a society and valuing an individual.Chaotic: A character will choose the good of the individual above that of everything else.Ethics:Good: The character tries to act in a moral and upstanding manner.Neutral: A character leans towards evaluating 'situational ethics' depending on the circumstances.Evil: A character acts without regard for others or in an overly malignant manner.For example, a Lawful Good character would be by-the-book when it came to upholding the good in society while a Chaotic Good character would be more willing to bend the rules in order to provide the same. A Lawful Evil character might hold their word as their bond and be loathe to break it for anyone, but would only give it if confronted by someone whose power they respect or as a part of one of their fell schemes. As interesting as this was, the game did not make an extensive use of the potential that this system could bring to an RPG.AttributesCharacter  attributes would help determine what classes were available for certain characters and how well they would perform in them. In 2nd Edition AD&amp;D, attribute scores of 18 were considered the highest possible in a natural sense, although racial bonuses and magical effects/enhancements in the form of spells or items would be able to raise them higher either temporarily or permanently in more rare cases. These are set as far as the game was concerned. Leveling improved a character's HP (hit points) and general abilities, but their base statistics would almost never change.EotB and its  following sequels would also allow the player to modify statistics during character creation with any number of changes that were limited only by the maximum level a particular attribute could be as determined by race.Strength: This determines the amount of physical damage that a character can inflict. With a strength statistic of 18, an additional variable is added to indicate exceptional strength as a percentage shown as 18/23.Constitution: A character's health and toughness is determined by this. In AD&amp;D, this has other effects outside of simply determining the HP amount gained after every level, such as a character's resistance to certain physical effects.Intelligence: A vital attribute for mages as they learn spells.Dexterity: Characters with a high dexterity tend to be nimble and agile improving their AC (armor class) which measures how hard they are to hit in combat. Important for every class, but more so with others such as fighters and thieves. With a score of 16 or higher, fighters can negate some of the penalties levied against them for using dual weapons.Charisma: This determines how attractive or repulsive a character is to everyone around them, whether it is in how they carry themselves in conversation or appear in public. Important for paladins.Wisdom: A character's innate ability to judge situations and make the best choices. It is also important in spell resistance and particularly key for clerics. Higher wisdom scores above 13 also translate into extra spells that clerics can utilize.[CR]Combat[CR]Fighting in the game is handled through random encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. The front ranks, determined by the two characters at the top of the party list, can engage in melee combat. All other characters must resort to ranged weapons or spells in order to join in the fight. An onscreen menu guides their actions and right clicking with the mouse on the appropriate icon, such as a warrior's sword, would cause them to act.Camping is available for the player to rest and heal the party, memorize spells, and save the game when necessary.[CR]NPC Companions[CR]As well as creating a party of player characters, during the adventure beneath the city of Waterdeep it is possible to find other adventurers who will offer their services to help the player characters in defeating Xanathar.TOD UPHILLTod is a Halfling Thief who accidentally fell down a sewer grate in the city of Waterdeep.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin is a variety of different games. The SNES version is a traditional side-scrolling action game whereas the Genesis version is a two player game that plays like a shooter. But instead of using guns, Batman and Robin uses Batarangs and other projectiles to take out their foes. The Sega CD version consists of just Batmobile levels.[CR]The SNES Version[CR]The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin was originally titled "Batman: The Animated Series" after the show. But since the show got a name change, the game was delayed and then renamed to what it is called today and Robin was added as an NPC. Despite his appearance in the game, Robin is not a playable character. Each level is based off episodes of the series and shared dialogue and moments from them. Before each level Batman must choose from a variety of different weapons to take with him.The SNES version had 8 levels:Level 1: Amused to DeathThe Joker and Harley Quinn broadcast a television message to Batman inviting him to meet them at The Joker's Funhouse.Boss: The JokerBased on the episode(s): Christmas with the Joker, Be A ClownLevel title cardLevel 2: No Green PeaceBizarre things are occurring at the forest in Gotham City suburban district there's only one person who would do such a thing. In this level, Batman refuses to use his fists, Bat Stars and Bat Explosives since there are only female enemies.Boss: Poison IvyBased on the episode(s): Pretty Poison, Eternal YouthLevel title cardLevel 3: Fowl PlayThere has been a break-in at the Gotham City Museum and it's up to Batman &amp; Robin to find the person responsible for this. Unfortunately, Robin is not a playable character in this level.Boss: PenguinBased on the episode(s): TBCLevel title cardLevel 4: Tale of the CatBatman is doing his nightly routine in the streets of Gotham City when he stumbles upon a familiar cat burglar lurking around.Boss: CatwomanBased on the episode(s): The Cat and The Claw part ILevel title cardLevel 5: Trouble in TransitTwo-Face has just robbed a bank and is making his escape.

Instead of using guns Batman and Robin use Batarangs. Levels are swarming with enemies and the player must "shoot" them to defeat them. If they get up close to the player then the heroes will either punch or kick them instead of throwing a Batarang. In some levels the player flies in a Batwing moving from the left to the right shooting down anything in their path. The plot features Mr. Freeze wanting to freeze Gotham . In the process he releases Joker, Two-Face, and Mad Hatter out of Arkham Asylum an attempt to distract Batman and Robin from his intentions. The Genesis version consists of four levels:Happy Birthday to Me!Bosses:Harley's RobotHarley QuinnJokerA Two-Sided StoryBosses:Two Face's AirshipLarge ShipTwo-FaceTea Time!Bosses:Giant CatGiant DollMad-HatterSnow in July?Boss:Mr. Freeze[CR]The Sega CD Version[CR]Pimp my ride!The Sega CD version is a 3D driving game with levels comprising only of driving the Batmobile and Batplane from point A to point B - shooting enemy vehicles along the way. The CD version is well known for having over 16 minutes of original animated footage created purely for the game with no involvement from Warner Bros. Animation. These cutscenes would later be known as 'The Lost Episode' from the animated series. All the principal voice actors from the series like Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Loren Lester, Arleen Sorkin and John Glover reprise their roles. The only thing missing from the source material is the original score by Danny Elfman and Shirley Walker. The game instead used its own "synth rock" style music.Enemies:Poison IvyThe RiddlerHarley QuinnThe JokerRupert ThorneClayface[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Control an F-14 Tomcat through over twelve levels of dogfights and air-to-ground combat.  Use of the Vulcan machine gun and missiles, as well as a turbo boost from the After Burner make for an exhilarating, though sometimes chugging flight. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of  4,6,5,7 adding, "...After Burner has long been the forefather to arcade dogfighting, and After Burner III is no exception.  This is a welcome addition to my Sega CD lineup".  A second reviewer though disagreed stating, "...the music is good but even the opening animations are unimpressive, with minor scaling and rotation.  The game play needs some work...". [CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The game was also known as Strike Fighter, which it was known as in the Japanese arcades before being adapted to become an After Burner sequel.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Fighter Aircraft[CR]Primary FightersBarnstormer - Fokker DR. 1: The ultra-maneuverable Fokker triplane was flown by the greatest combat ace of WWI, the Red Baron. It's three-wing design earned it the nickname "Tripe."Warbird - P38 Lightning: The most ominous-looking fighter of WWII, the P38 was nicknamed "Fork-Tailed Devil" by pilots who flew against it.Jet - F16 Fighting Falcon: One of the meanest multi-purpose light fighters ever made, the F16 is as much at home blasting ground targets as it is in dogfights.Upgrade FightersBarnstormer - The Spad XIII: The rugged Spad XIII was piloted by many French aces in WWI as well as by the top scoring American ace, Eddie Rickenbacker.Barnstormer - Travel-Air Mystery Ship: The "Mystery Ship" took the first Thompson Trophy Race by storm in 1929.Warbird - P51 Mustang: Many consider the Mustang to be the finest fighter of WWII.Warbird - J7W1 Shinden: The Shinden's powerful engine and "pusher" design make it a formidable combat machine.Jet - MiG29 Fulcrum: Russia's answer to NATO's front-line fighters, the Fulcrum is fast, maneuverable and deadly.Jet - F23 Black Widow: A lethal combination of stealth and firepower, the Black Widow certainly earns its name.There is also a member of the black market who sells more airplanes for you to pilot.[CR]The Game[CR]The game design is similar to Super Mario Kart. You race in seasons with the completion of each race giving you points for your position and at the end get a ranking. Also similar as you race you can fly through various power ups, such as weapons and health boosters.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The story takes place in Japan, you play as Hayate, a young up and coming ninja warrior out to stop the evil of Lougi and his army of ghouls and goblins. You are out to avenge your father's death as well as the emperor and rescue your girlfriend from the clutches of evil and bring an end to the terror visited upon your lands.[CR]Some of the villians you face are Marco Killmore (a half man, half eagle samurai warrior), Zallen (a disgraced samurai warrior out to destroy Hayate), Vengor (a stone shiva-type character), Desfal (a medusa-like woman), Destroyer MPK (a possessed collection of samurai armor) and of course the evil samurai knight himself, Lougi.[CR]To play the game you must press the corresponding buttons on the screen at a certain time, such as pressing left to go left or possibly to avoid a enemies weapon or pressing one of the regular buttons to draw your weapon and attack a certain enemy, much like Dragon's Lair and Space Ace. There are three difficulty levels, each one giving you a certain amount of time to press the buttons, the hardest setting giving you the least amount of time.</plot>

				<title_clean>Revengers Of Vengeance</title_clean>
				<plot>Revengers of Vengeance is a combination RPG/vertical shooter/fighting game with a fantasy/anime style. There are ten available characters, each with their own animated backstory and fighting techniques. You must choose a hero and guide their stats to create a formidable fighter capable of taking down the Devil King and freeing the land.[CR]In the Quest mode, you name your selected character and start at a lowly Level 1. The local town acts as a hub with opportunities for training, equipment purchases and rest. You can leave town and battle contenders for money in the fighting game. You can advance the story by taking quests from the town's guild, which are played in the vertical shooter game.[CR]The fighting engine is further explored in two side modes - Tournament and Arena of Death. Tournament acts as a basic fighting game, allowing 1 or 2 players to progress through the ranks with the stock characters. No customization is available in this mode.[CR]Arena of Death allows eight players to be created using the stock character templates. You assign attributes by shifting various bars between two extremes. You can then match these creations against each other and watch as the computer simulates a battle between them. The primary use of this mode appears to be testing various tactics against each other to decide how best to play your character.</plot>

				<title_clean>Rise Of The Dragon</title_clean>
				<plot>Rise of the Dragon is a predominantly first-person adventure game with some action elements thrown in, much like the other adventure game released by Dynamix at about the same time,   Heart of China.  In Rise of the Dragon players take on the role of an ex-cop private detective who gets swept up in a sinister plot created by a Fu Manchu-like adversary.  While much of the style of the game borrows heavily from Blade Runner (the main character and protagonist's name is Blade, perhaps as an homage to the film) and its hard boiled spiritual predecessors (with crowded, dingy L.A. streets, seedy bars, strong Eastern influences, trench coats, and cynical attitudes), there are high adventure pulp elements as well, with broadly drawn caricatures as enemies and allies, as well as the "chosen one" trope used since prehistory and a pseudo-historical Eastern cult which vaguely resembles the   Cthulhu mythos in its modern-yet-supernatural scope.Players have access to various map locations accessible by subway trains, more of which open up as clues are uncovered and puzzles are solved.  The puzzles themselves use inventory and exploration, as well as experimentation with devices found in the environment.  There are also dialogue choices during conversations, and a few action sequences during key moments.The art style emulates certain comic book styles, with slightly exaggerated, emotive faces.  There are some photorealistic touches, such as the bitmapped photographic frames used during telephone message sequences (which is jarring when you consider that the same people who leave messages for you have comic book-style equivalent faces when you meet them in person).Some of the puzzles and events are also time-based.  Players must pay attention to a clock and calendar in the upper-right portion of the screen.  You will, for example, have a date scheduled for a day and time, and your date expects you to arrive promptly.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Road Avenger is an 1985 FMV laserdisc-based arcade game that was was developed by Data East and featured animation by Toei. While the game is known as Road Blaster in Japan, it was released internationally as Road Avenger as well as Road Prosecutor. The name change was possibly to avoid confusion with the Atari game called RoadBlasters.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Road Avenger is set in the late 1990s in a post-apocalyptic American wasteland and follows a vigilante ex-cop taking vengeance against the gang responsible for the death of his wife.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Road Avenger was an FMV interactive action movie game, essentially played as a series of enormous Quick Time Event car chases, with the player reacting to on-screen prompts/situations to steer, accelerate, and brake the car.While it has similar gameplay to other laserdisc games like Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, Ninja Hayate, and Time Gal, Road Avenger is significantly more interactive and action-packed. In Road Avenger, the player is constantly needing to react by performing various different actions at a fast pace.Road Avenger has nine levels, each ending with a ranking based on the player's reaction time.It has three difficulty modes. Hard Mode does not having any on-screen prompts at all, but the player needs to react based on the situations. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. [CR]There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.[CR]There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.[CR]If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.[CR]The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]MegaRace is an MS-DOS PC title by Cryo Interactive released in the early 90s. The player is thrust into the role of a contestant on a game show in which the goal is to battle gangs in an armored, weapon equipped vehicle in dysotopian enivronments.Darkly humorous FMV scenes featuring the show's host, Lance Boyle, helped create the atmosphere of a slightly inhumane, high-stakes game show, but the actual gameplay was not much more than a futuristic Chase H.Q. clone, albeit a futuristic Chase H.Q. clone with pretty pre-rendered graphics. Many Packard Bell multi-media computers of the time came with the game pre-installed to show off the power of the CD-ROM medium, which had just come into vogue with the release of Myst in 1993.The game was ported to the 3DO and Sega CD a few months after its release on PC.A MegaRace Reboot is in the works by the Bernie Stolar headed Firm, ZOOM.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Mickey Mania - The Timeless Adventures Of Mickey Mouse</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse (known in Europe as Mickey Mania) is a side-scrolling platformer developed by Traveller's Tales (in conjunction with Psygnosis) and published by Sony Imagesoft for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on October 1994 and for the Genesis and Sega CD on November 1994. The Japanese version was only released for the SNES (by Capcom) and Genesis (by Sega).Originally developed to celebrate the 65th birthday of Disney mascot Mickey Mouse, the game has the titular mouse adventuring through some of his various short films (from the 1928 Steamboat Willie to the 1990 The Prince and the Pauper) as he must find his past selves, rescue his dog Pluto, and defeat Pete.Made in collaboration with Disney, the game is one of the few games to feature digitized animations from Disney-affiliated animation studios (from the Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida division in collaboration with Creative Capers Entertainment).Each subsequent version of the game includes new sequences and minor additions. For example, both the Sega console versions add a new hidden bonus sequence (based on the 1935 short film The Band Concert) and a "spiral staircase" sequence in the second level. The Sega CD version features both redbook audio and digitized voice samples of Mickey, as well as an extra sequence before the final boss.The game was later ported on March 1996 to the PlayStation in Europe (as Mickey's Wild Adventure), featuring enhanced graphics and graphical effects and a new "chase" sequence in the fifth level (where Mickey is pursued by Willie the Giant). This version was later digitally re-released via PlayStation Network on December 13, 2011 (in Europe) for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mickey Mania is fairly typical of the side-scrolling platform genre. Players guide Mickey from left to right through levels, passing obstacles through  jumping or  solving puzzles. Enemies can be defeated either by jumping on them or by  throwing marbles at them. The game is famously difficult: a lot of this difficulty is because some of the game requires a lot of precise timing and many of the enemies are hard to defeat without taking damage.At the top left hand corner of the screen is Mickey's Glove. The number under the glove symbolizes the number of lives the player has remaining and the fingers of the glove show how many hits Mickey can take before losing a life.[CR]Items[CR]In Mickey Mania there are three types of items at Mickey's disposal, each with a different purpose:Stars: These give you 1 health (finger) back per star. If Mickey has full health and gets the stars, they will disappear and he will NOT get an extra life.Marbles: The main tool for getting through most levels in this game. Marbles are everywhere to collect and the serve as a means of hitting enemies and bosses. They are transferable from level to level though Mickey has a holding limit of 99 marbles.Mouse Ears: Mickey's Mouse Ears can come in very handy and are in secretive locations throughout the game. They replenish one full life, regardless if you have not previously lost a life.[CR]Cartoons Featured as Levels[CR]There are a total of 7 levels to play through in Mickey Mania.Steamboat Willie (1928)The level starts Mickey out on the steamboat from the famous 1928 animated short, and after a short time on the boat the level continues on land. Mickey is faced with challenging platforming elements already on the first stage, and he'll also meet  Pete as a  mini boss in this stage. At the end of the level Mickey can actually find two branching paths: one that leads to a crane boss battle, and another, which leads Mickey to a secret area with tons of marbles and  1-ups.In the level Mickey will find small details from the animated short, like the "musical goat" and the iconic boat-horns.The Mad Doctor (1933)This level starts up with a little homage to  Dragon's Lair by basically copying the start of the game. Mickey continues through The Mad Doctor's  castle and is faced with classic enemies like  skeletons and  bats; Mickey are even meets with a  elevator and an on-rail jumping section. At the end Mickey fights The Mad Doctor and saves his dog  Pluto before the poor hound is experimented upon.The Band Concert (1935)This is a secret bonus level in which players must navigate to the top of a  tornado. This is basically one of the tower sections and as such is not featured in the SNES version.Moose Hunters (1937)Players follow Pluto (In the cartoon,  Goofy and  Donald were alongside Mickey, not Pluto) through this level. Enemies including a  moose who charges at Mickey and environmental hazards too such as falling branches and boulders.Lonesome Ghosts (1937)This level features the titular lonesome  ghosts who attempt to halt Mickey's progress with all sorts of tricks and jokes. This level has some tricky sections and a memorable section where water levels rise and fall.Mickey and the Beanstalk (1947)This level forces Mickey to "do some gardening" and has him contend with not just a giant (Additionally, an escape section featuring the giant is in CD versions, though not others) but also a giant spider. This level features the only friendly  NPC in the game apart from various Mickeys and Pluto - a  ladybug who helps Mickey escape the spider.The Prince and the Pauper (1990)The game makes a large jump in time (43 years) to feature The Prince and the Pauper. This level features the most difficult combat in the game, including a boss battle against a very powerful Pete which has two forms.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Released on the Sega/Mega CD, 3DO, Amiga CD32 and the PC (DOS game), in 1993. Developed, produced and distributed by   psygnosis LTD.  There are some slight difference between the versions. With the PC and 3DO versions looking the best.  The game has some quite interesting concepts, being set entirely within the confines of a human body. And also has political as well as environmental overtones.Explore the human body!It is the mid twenteith century ,and two gigantic global corporations are fighting for control of the planet. There aims are complete supremacy and hegemony over all. The earth is an overcrowded, over polluted mess. Cyber-Tech Industries, one of the two dominant company's on the planet, is being challenged by it's only real rival the Axiom corporation, who blame Cyber-tech for their president's (CEO's) death. To gain revenge and therefore total domination they secretly inject Cyber-Tech's president, Mr Anton Korsby, with a deadly genetically altered virus that threatens to take control of his body and ultimately destroy him, and bring down CyberTech with him. Your mission is to enter president Korsby's body and locate the virus at it's source and destroy it, before the organism takes complete control of his central nervous system.AmigaCD 32 screen shotMicrocosm is a 3D action shooter. Your job is to pilot your way through various parts of the anatomy lungs, veins etc, blasting enemy ships while trying to aviod interfering with his vital organs. Your vessel will become faster and stronger as the game progresses by picking up power-ups which will aid you in your mission to save the president as quickly as possible. Eventually you will make your way up to the brain, where you must defeat Grey M, the parasite that is trying to control Korsby's body.Microcosm makes use of the larger  storage abilitiy of the CD format. Using it  to cram in lots of   full-motion video (FMV) and with high-resolution fractal graphics, which are used to great effect to simulate the walls of veins/arteries. Also digital music can be heard throughout the game as well as a good selection of digital sound effects, simulating internal bodily sounds.  The Sega CD version of the game was later sold with  Ultraverse Prime.  [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR]The Mission[CR]"Operation Midnight", a simple reconnaissance mission, looks straight forward enough. As the rookie gunner of the first Apache "Dragonfly", your job is to rescue Victor Mensch, a world renowned expert on nerve gases who is being held hostage at the Al Shakkur chemical installation deep in enemy territory.As the rookie of the Midnight Raiders team, you're psyched to get up there and show them what you're made of. But within seconds, two Blackhawk troop carriers are shot down over enemy targets. Waiting for your next command from OpCom, you suddenly realize something has gone terribly wrong. With only 2 choppers and no air cover, you're chances of making it out alive are getting slimmer by the minute. And yet, CIA agent Adams refuses to abort "Operation Midnight".Now there's no turning back. You've got to penetrate a wall of heavily armed security guards, retrieve the hostage, plant a tactical nuke in a specific locale and get out of the plant before it blows. All Adams asks is that you "extract the professor and leave no traces".As you dive into danger, first in the air, than on foot and finally by jeep, you can't help but wonder - why was this seemingly ill-fated missions ordered to continue? Could it be that you - a rookie shooter - are completely expendable at the hands of one crooked bureaucrat?`Taken straight out of the Sega CD manual`[CR]</plot>

Gameplay revolves around watching the action scenes and pushing the buttons whenever a Power Ranger kicks or punches, and also pressing directions to dodge of throw enemies. Since the footage has only one outcome you are given a life bar and whenever you miss the timing of your button presses it decreases until you have lost and it's game over. However during the morphing sequences, you regain a portion of your health. Correctly pressing the buttons also adds to your score; get a high score and see where you place on the in-game leaderboard.There are three difficulties with each subsequently harder one giving you an extra episode, so if you play on the easy setting you aren't getting to play along with two episodes.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Mortal Kombat</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]GET OVER HERE!Mortal Kombat is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway in 1992 for arcades. After initial popularity, it was ported to most fourth-generation consoles (in a special event known as "Mortal Monday").The game was controversial due to the combination of excessive gore and violence (including post-battle execution moves known as Fatalities) and fully-digitized character graphics, two concepts that were introduced to the fighting game genre by Mortal Kombat. Originally designed as a video game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme (whose likeness can be seen in the character Johnny Cage), the game introduced a monstrous franchise that spawned a multitude of sequels, a series of comic books, music CDs, a live tour, two television shows, and two major motion pictures (Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat Annihilation).The game revolves around the brutal Mortal Kombat tournament held in a hidden island ruled by the evil sorceror Shang Tsung (whose half-dragon, half-human bodyguard, Goro, remains the undefeated champion of the tournament). Each of the seven playable characters enter the tournament for different reasons (some for revenge, while others for glory). The main protagonist is Liu Kang, a Shaolin Monk of the White Lotus society who wants to bring honor back to the Mortal Kombat tournament. The main storyline was expanded through comics and sequels, involving the evil forces of Outworld, who use the tournament in order to take over Earth (known as Earthrealm).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade button layout in the classic "X" formation.Mortal Kombat plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. The 5-button layout was laid out in an "X" pattern and featured High Punch and Low Punch on the left, High Kick and Low Kick on the right, and a dedicated Block button (a first for 2D fighting games) in the middle. Depending on the distance and joystick position, players can perform uppercuts, roundhouse kicks, backhand punches, and leg sweeps. The game introduced special moves that do not require circular joystick movement or holding the joystick in a certain direction. Scorpion's trademark Spear Throw for instance is performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then pressing the low punch button. The game also introduced special moves that do not require any button presses, such as Raiden's Flying Torpedo, performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then tapping towards the opponent on the joystick once.This is the only fighting game in the franchise to include a scoring system (using points) for its high score table. Players earn points by damaging other players, winning a round, and winning the Test Your Might mini-game. The amount of points for winning the round is based on time, amount of damage taken (taking no damage in a round results in a Flawless Victory bonus, while taking no damage in the second round results in a Double Flawless bonus of 500,000 points), and whether or not the player performs a Fatality (which earns the player 100,000 points).FatalitiesFATALITY!One key feature of the fighting game genre made possible (and famous) by Mortal Kombat is the Fatality, which serves as a glorified finishing move that can only be performed upon a losing player at the end of the final round. Fatalities are special button and joystick combinations that are time-restricted. Failing to perform one usually results in the opponent falling unceremoniously to the ground, with the only penalty being a loss of the Fatality bonus. Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile do not perform Fatalities, and likewise players can not perform a Fatality on Goro or Shang Tsung. Other than The Pit Stage Fatality, performing a Fatality earns the player 100,000 points. In some home versions, Fatalities are referred to as "Finishing Moves".Simply performing an uppercut (or performing Liu Kang's Fatality) on The Pit will knock the opponent over the side of the bridge, who will then be impaled through the spikes below. This is not available in the Sega Genesis (without the Blood Code activated), Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, or Sega Master System versions.Test Your MightRaiden chopping a pile of wood for bonus points.Every three matches against the CPU opponent or every five matches against human opponents brings the player(s) to a mini-game called "Test Your Might", which requires each player to repeatedly tap certain buttons to build up a yellow bar (which quickly decreases). Once the bar reaches a certain point, the player presses another button to attempt to chop the object placed in front of them. The required point of breakage and points awarded for a successful chop is increased for each level. (100,000 points for Wood, 200,000 points for Stone, 500,000 points for Steel, 750,000 points for Ruby, and 1,000,000 points for Diamond)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character Selection Screen with player one as Kano and player two as Sub-Zero.The game includes seven playable characters and two bosses. After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all seven combatants (including a mirror match), then progress through three "endurance matches" (in which players must defeat two opponents consecutively to win a round), and then battle the two bosses: Goro and Shang Tsung.Introduced in later versions of the arcade (and the home console ports) is the unplayable Reptile, the third ninja palette swap with moves of both Scorpion and Sub-Zero. He randomly appears before matches to provide clues on how to reach him. If the player can decipher these hints, they will know that Reptile can be fought by performing a Fatality on The Pit stage without taking damage or blocking in the final round, and even then he will only show himself if a shadow appears over the moon in the background at some point during the match. Defeating him earns the player 10,000,000 points.[CR]Johnny Cage[CR](not available in the Game Boy version)Actor: Daniel Pesina</plot>

The game explores the duo's interpersonal interactions with other patrons at the bar: There's the Fly, an aloof cool guy; Ted and Gomez, braindead surfer dudes trying to pick up the ladies, and who are thinly-veiled parodies of Bill &amp; Ted; Poindexter, the nerd who is also trying to work up the courage to talk to the women; and Flo and Tiger, a pair of leather-clad tough chicks whose interest is beating the main subjects of the game so that they can control the bar music and play their Megadeth videotape. Each person or pair has own their ideas about what an ideal INXS video should or should not contain. The specifications normally come in the form of a set of pictures they either do or don't want to see, and perhaps some effects. The game features three INXS videos from which to choose: "Heaven Sent", "Not Enough Time", and "Baby Dont Cry".[CR]After receiving the video specifications, the player enters the video editing console in the EditChallenge mode. From this console, the player can view and select between 3 video streams that are playing. The selected stream will be edited into the final video. One stream is the original video while the other 2 feature assorted random footage that nonetheless often carries images that happened to have been specified in the video request. The video editing console also allows the player to apply a variety of real-time filters, such as mosaic and blur filters, RGB color filters, strobe and motion filters, lyric subtitles, among others.[CR]The game also allows the user to enter a mode called U-Direct.

When complete, judges will score the resultant video.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 3,5,5,6 adding, "...You watch a bunch of footage while the song plays. Then you hear the song again and see the video... it's getting old. The same film footage for the videos is always being reused and the video effects seem weak..."[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Panic! is a surreal adventure puzzle game for the Sega CD, developed by Sega and published by Data East in the United States in 1994. The game is like a lot of Sega CD games of the era that can only be loosely described as a "game" at all. The plot of the game is that a computer that controls the world has gone corrupt and has caused the world's electronic devices to go haywire. It's up to a boy and his dog to find their way to the central computer and fix it, to do this players must push a variety of switches and hope for the best. Quite literally that's the game, each scene in the game has a panel of switches that you can press with only one advancing you forward, some will take you backwards to the previous scene and some will just make weird things happen (such as whales flying by inside your house). There is a map that allows you to chart your progress, and there is an ending to the game.The game was re-released in Japan for the Playstation 2 in 2002.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Panic! was not well-received at the time, being one of only 12 games to receive a score of 1.0 or lower from Gamepro magazine.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Popful Mail - Magical Fantasy Adventure</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Popful Mail is a 2D side-scrolling action game from Nihon Falcom, the creators of Ys and Dragon Slayer. It features Mail, an overambitious elven bounty hunter, and her two companions Tatt (a naive wizard's apprentice) and Gaw (a small, bat-like dragon) that the player can switch between as soon as those characters have joined the party. The game plays similarly to Wonder Boy in Monster Land, or Falcom's own Legacy of the Wizard or Ys III, with characters exploring each stage and defeating enemies to earn money which can then be spent on better equipment or curative consumables.Originally released in 1991 for the NEC PC-9801 home computer, Falcom would eventually publish a version for the Super Famicom in 1994. The same year, Sega published a version for the Sega CD (which would later be published in the US by Working Designs in 1995) and NEC did the same for the PC Engine CD.The PC-9801 and PC Engine CD games are almost identical, though the latter benefits from the CD storage with its improved graphics, cutscenes and redbook audio. The Sega CD version increases the size of the playable character and emphasizes the combat and platforming, while streamlining the exploration aspects and aging up the cutesy characters for cutscenes. The Super Famicom version is similar to the Sega CD version, but lacks a lot of features (including the animated, voiced cutscenes) due to the limitations of the platform.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Power Monger</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Power Monger, or Powermonger, is a god sim game from Populous creator Peter Molyneux. It builds on Populous, borrowing elements but adding a whole lot more besides, including a 3D map that can be rotated around to an extent and an "artificial life" engine that allows for complex AI behavior that occurs naturally with little amounts of input from the player.It was released on many European and Japanese home computers, as well as on the SNES, Sega Genesis and Sega CD consoles in multiple regions. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game features a 3D game map, although camera movement was limited to rotating the map in 90-degree intervals and 8 pre-defined levels of zoom. Only the map itself is three dimensional, people, trees and other game objects where comprised of sprites. The game also features a fairly advanced "artificial life" engine. Each person seem to have a mind of their own and will go about his or her job, fishing, farming, shepherding, collecting wood or making items without any input from the player. On death, citizens and soldiers alike would rise heavenwards in angelic form. The player also have a query tool that can be used to see the name, sex, age, allegiance, vital stats, hometown and equipment for any given person they click on. While the player cannot form the land, their actions can still have some limited effect on the environment. For example if the player deforests a big area the weather pattern will change and more rain or snow (depending on season) will fall, making movement slower.The player starts out on each map with a small number of soldiers, and maybe a few towns already under their control. To win the map they need to tip the balance of power completely to their side (represented by a scale below the mini-map), by conquering all (or at least most) of the towns on the map, and kill any opposing captains. Once a town is under the player's control, they can draft the locals into their army and take on bigger towns or enemy armies. Some of the bigger towns also have neutral captains and if these survive the battle and the player conquers the town they come under their command as well. The player can only control as many armies as they have captains so it's important to keep them alive - if a captain is killed his army is disbanded and his surviving solders go back to their town of origin. Unlike the main army which the main character commands, the subordinate captains have a "lag" time. The further away from the main character they are, the longer it takes for orders to reach them. When issuing orders via the captains, a useful and sometimes amusing feedback is provided: the affirmative voice sample is played at a pitch that signals the wisdom of the player's commands.Food is the single most important resource in the game, the expression "an army marches on its belly" is very true in Power Monger, therefore it is often smart to not to draft a whole town's population into an army, because an empty town will not produce food (or more people). Aside from friendly towns the player can also slaughter wandering sheep (by ordering the army to attack it), barter food from neutral towns, or kill an enemy captain and pillage his food supply. Aside from manpower and food towns can also provide equipment. Townspeople will occasionally make stuff, but to speed things up the player can order an army to "invent" at a friendly town. Depending on nearby resources and what posture the army is set to (passive, neutral or aggressive) the player's men will then go to work collecting resources and make items. As the more useful items can usually only be made in one or two towns on any given map these have great strategic importance.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Prince Of Persia</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia 1989Prince of Persia was originally released in 1989 for the  Apple II by  Jordan Mechner. Mechner used film of his younger brother David running, jumping, and performing many of the Prince's actions. Mechner then  rotoscoped the film to create the animations that give the  Prince his fluid movement.Part of the game's appeal was its then unique focus on  environmental puzzle-solving, as well as its one-on-one  sword duels. Mechner has stated that the game was inspired by the first ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the character's  acrobatics in a  dangerous environment.Prince of Persia has since been ported to a number of different platforms, including the  Amiga,  Apple Macintosh, DOS,  NES,  Game Boy,  Sega Genesis,  Game Gear,  SNES,  Sharp X68000,  Atari ST, and SAM Coup&#233;.The music was written by Jordan Mechner's father,  Francis Mechner.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia is a platformer with heavy emphasis on careful jumping and environmental puzzle solving. The player controls the Prince as he attempts to  rescue his princess before she  weds  Jaffar, the evil Grand Vizier. Jaffar has trapped the  Princess, and given her an hour to decide whether she wishes to marry him or die. This hour unfolds in  real time, and the only way to lose the game is to fail to reach the Princess within sixty minutes.The player is given only an hour to navigate the game's thirteen levels and rescue her. Scattered throughout each level are hidden  switches, secret  pitfalls and a variety of other hazards standing in the Prince's way of rescuing his beloved. There are also hidden  potions that have a variety of effects on the Prince.The player will have to explore and pay attention to their environment in order to solve the puzzles and make it to the end. The Prince will also have to fight his way past  guards to reach the Princess. Combat exists as a series of sword fights, which were unusual for its time when  projectile weapons were the norm.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Sultan of Persia, one day, leaves to wage war in a foreign land. His Grand Vizier, Jaffar, steps in to take his  throne while he is away. Shortly thereafter, a street urchin decides to climb the Royal Tower to see the Princess, whom people have claimed to be as beautiful as a new moon. When the young  orphan finally sees the Princess,  they fall in love. The couple intend to marry.The Vizier discovers this and decides that he wants to marry the Princess. He throws the street urchin into the lowest  dungeon and locks the Princess in the highest tower. He then gives the Princess one hour, counted on a magical  hourglass, in which she has to decide to marry the Vizier or die.The street urchin's main goal is to defeat Jaffar and reach the Princess.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The SNES versionAside from being ported to several different platforms, Prince of Persia has received  two  proper  sequels and a  3D remake.  Ubisoft re-imagined the series with its  Sands of Time  trilogy, and the French publisher again rebooted the series with a new game, titled simply  Prince of Persia. A motion picture based on  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is also being developed, Mike Newell directing, and is being produced by  Jerry Bruckheimer. The movie was released in 2010 starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, and  Ben Kingsley and was received with average reviews.The game was  ported many times, and version such as the  SNES one which improved on the original. In the SNES game, the graphics were updated, and the game was given 20 levels, and an extra hour to complete the game.The original Prince of Persia has sold over 2 million copies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 8,8,7,5 adding, "...very impressed with this version of the game. Not only were all the characters and pitfalls very easy to see on the small screen, but even the very fluid animation found on the other versions of the game was duplicated almost perfectly".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]We follow Puggsy who has crash landed on an alien planet 15 light years away from his home planet. The inhabitants of the planet have stolen his spaceship which stops him from being able to find his way home.You find your way through many levels where there is no set path and you can find your own way around, with the main objective of getting your spaceship back from 'The Racoons'[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Puggsy is a platformer, which means it works pretty much in the same way as others: Up, Down, Left, Right, Pick up, Put down, Throw. However, many of the levels involve puzzles which are required in order to progress.Puggsy uses Total Object Interaction which is the system that allows real world physics to come into play. Certain objects in the game can be picked up and used in some way to help you complete the level. You can even stack objects, such as barrels to help you reach the higher platforms. You can also throw these objects at the enemies, or even pick up a gun and shoot them. Also, the object you carry will make you weigh more, so you wont be able to jump as high depending on your weight. Each object has a different weight to it, from a balloon that will help you float to a weight that will sink you quickly.The goal of each level is to reach the exit. Optionally, you may bring items with you through the exit door to give you more points. Often times levels will involve finding a key and unlocking a chest to reach the most valuable item to take back with you. If you're crafty, you can bring multiple things in the doorway with you, netting you those precious extra points. You can also replay any levels that you like, which is helpful if you need points or a pair of sunglasses or trainers for Puggsy.[CR]Special Items[CR]Sunglasses - Not only used to look awesome, they act as a shield for one hit.Shield - Makes you temporarily invincible when activated.Trainers - When worn, provides a speed and jump height boost.
