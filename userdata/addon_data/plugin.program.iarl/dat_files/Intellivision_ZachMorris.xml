Development of the console began in 1978, less than a year after the introduction of its main competitor, the Atari 2600. The word intellivision is a portmanteau of "intelligent television". Over 3 million Intellivision units were sold and a total of 125 games were released for the console.[CR]Developer:  Mattel[CR]Manufacturer:  Mattel[CR]CPU:  GI CP1610[CR]Memory:  1456 bytes of RAM[CR]Graphics:  General Instrument CP1610[CR]Sound:  General Instrument AY-3-8910[CR]Display:  159x96[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max Controllers:  1</emu_comment>

				<plot>Intellivision Backgammon is identical with the board game. Backgammon is a game played by two players (the computer can be one of the players). Each player has 15 pieces. The object of the game is to be the first to move all your pieces completely around and finally off the board. Moving your pieces off the board is called "bearing off". The first player to bear off all his pieces is the winner. Each player moves in a direction beginning from his opponent's Home Table and coming around to his own Home Table. Thus one player always moves clockwise and the other always [CR]counterclockwise.[CR]You can play against the computer at two skill levels - one for beginners or intermediate, another for experts - or two players can compete against each other. It displays the American Backgammon Players Association (ABPA) logo.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Armor Battle was originally released in 1979 for the     Intellivision, and was developed by Chris Kingsley of    APh Technological Consulting for   Mattel Electronics. The game takes two sides, Blue and Black, and pits their massive armies of tanks against each other in two-on-two battles on small battlefields full of buildings, water, roads, and forests. Since there is no computer AI to control a vacant side, Armor Battle is strictly a two-player game, and a solo player won't find much challenge in shooting down inactive tanks.An  Atari 2600 version was released in 1982 as a part of the M Network series, and was titled Armor Ambush.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Armor Battle, each side starts the game with 50 tanks. While players could potentially keep playing until one side's tanks have been destroyed, this could take a long time, and the instruction manual instead suggests setting a personal limit outside of the game, either through a set amount of battles or time.When a round of battle begins, a random map out of over 240 configurations is chosen, and two tanks from the Blue and Black forces are placed on each side of the map. Players take control of one tank at a time, and attempt to destroy both of the enemy's tanks. The active tank can be switched at any time, with the inactive tank changing to a flat, right-facing sprite. Tanks    A round of battle     move sluggishly, though their speed is determined by the surface they are driving on. Roads provide the fastest movement speed, while forests and water significantly slow tanks down.Tanks can fire shots that travel up to half the screen, jarring the firing tank and any enemy targets it hits. Buildings can be used as cover from shells, and forests will provide a chance to absorb shells. It takes three shells to destroy a tank, leaving a pile of rubble where once a functioning war machine existed.Once per round, players can opt to plant an invisible land mine at the current position of the active tank. After five seconds, this mine becomes active, and any tank that drives over its location will instantly explode into rubble. This includes the tank that planted the mine, should they be foolish enough to remain in place for five seconds or drive back over the mine's location.A round ends once both tanks for a side have been destroyed. The winning side carries their surviving tanks into future rounds of battle, so it is always in the interest of players to try and destroy at least one enemy tank in each round, to limit their opponent to a one-tank advantage in the event of a loss.[CR]</plot>

As the game progresses, the objects become faster and more numerous, and the tempo of the game, including the game's background "music" of a single cymbal-like sound, increases to a frantic pace.The player controls a gun, called a "laser battery" by the instruction manual, which can fire a white laser blast straight into the air to destroy incoming objects. These lasers can be fired in manual bursts, or set to auto-fire at an interval. The battery can slide horizontally along the ground, or use a risky "hyper space" maneuver to warp to a random spot on the ground.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]While any falling object hitting the laser battery will cost the player a life, most objects can be avoided with little to no consequence. The only exception to this are Spinners, which will automatically cost the player a life if they reach the ground.MeteorsThere are two sizes of meteors, big and small. These colorful rocks will fall at varying angles and speeds, and disappear once they touch the ground. While it isn't critical to destroy every meteor that falls, every meteor that touches the ground will cause a player's score to go down. In addition, big meteors may split into two small meteors when shot.SpinnersThere are also two sizes of Spinners, big and small. Spinners are white spinning bombs that make a falling sound upon entering the screen. They are arguably the most critical enemies to destroy, as if they are allowed to touch the ground, they will destroy the laser battery and cost the player a life. Like meteors, their angle and speed vary.Guided MissilesEmitting a beeping sound upon entering the screen, guided missiles look like pulsing white diamonds. These missiles fall at a fast rate, homing in on the battery's location and tracking its movement. If guided missiles are allowed to touch the ground, they may slide along the ground towards the battery. The only way to avoid a guided missile once it is sliding along the ground is to use hyper space to warp to the other side of it, although it may still re-lock onto the player and continue sliding towards their location.UFOsThese will only appear once the player has reached the 4x multiplier level. UFOs move horizontally across the top of the screen, emitting a constant sonar-like beep, and will fire square bombs at the laser battery. Both the UFO and bombs can be destroyed with laser fire.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Points are scored for destroying anything that falls or flies (except UFO bombs). A player loses points for letting meteors hit the ground or dying. The pre-multiplier breakdown is as follows:Big meteors: 10 points Letting a big meteor land: -5 points Small meteors: 20 points Letting a small meteor land: -10 points Big Spinner: 40 points Small Spinner: 80 points Guided missile: 50 points UFO: 100 points Losing a life: -100 points  Because a player can lose points, the game keeps track of the player's current score and peak score, displaying the peak score at the game over screen. The current score affects the speed and difficulty, and also determines the multiplier level of points scored or subtracted. The color of the sky changes to signify the multiplier level a player is on.1x (Black sky): 0 - 999 points 2x (Blue sky): 1,000 - 4,999 points 3x (Purple sky): 5,000 - 19,999 points 4x (Turquoise sky): 20,000 - 49,999 points 5x (Grey sky): 50,000 - 99,999 points 6x (Black sky): 100,000 points or more  It is possible to drop down multiplier levels due to death or letting too many meteors hit the ground.[CR][B]Releases:[/B][CR]The Atari 2600 version of Astrosmash is called "Astroblast".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Atari 2600 VersionAtlantis is a fixed screen shooter by Imagic, released in 1982.The player controls up to three (depending on difficulty settings) gun towers, used to destroy incoming enemy ships which attempt to destroy various parts of Atlantis, including the gun towers themselves. As enemy ships pass through the screen unharmed, they progressively make lower passes until they are at the lowest level, where they deploy a destructive energy beam. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A ship reaches the lowest levelIn order to defend the city, the player has up to three cannons. The main cannon, positioned in the middle, shoots straight up and is fired by pressing the button by itself. Two support cannons are also available on either side of the screen. These cannons shoot at an angle and are fired by holding left or right on the joystick (depending on which gun you want to fire) and pressing the button. After successfully defending each wave, the subsequent volley of ships comes a bit faster. Additionally, certain ships fly faster than others. Similar to Missile Command, lost structures and cannons can be regained at higher scores. [CR]Notes[CR]A very rare version of Atlantis called "Atlantis II" also exists. It was sent to the high-scorers of Imagic's "Defend Atlantis" contest in order to determine the final four finalists. This version is a faster and much more challenging version of the game.Note that the ship that escapes the city once the player loses looks a lot like a ship from another Imagic game, called Cosmic Ark.In the instructions to Cosmic Ark, the pilots of the mothership which is central to the game are even referred to as Atlanteans, suggesting that the game Atlantis takes place either before or after Cosmic Ark, or at least in the same creative universe.The Intellivision version of this game had additional features, including spotlights used during the night raids, and a targeting reticule which more closely suggested the game play from Missile Command than the straight-shooting 2600 version of the defensive cannons did.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>B-17 Bomber</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]B-17 Bomber gives players control of a USAAF B-17 stationed in England, and a map full of potential targets in continental Europe. The player then selects one of the targets as a destination, pilots the bomber to the selected target, and attempts to bomb it successfully to earn points.The Intellivision controller proves very useful in B-17 Bomber, as it uses the number pad layout to allow players to quickly switch between different viewpoints and information screens. In addition, the Intellivoice module gives players distinct voice clips as audio cues during gameplay. Some of these sounds include your bombardier saying, "Bombs away!" as bombs are dropped, and other crew members yelling out the direction of enemy fighters; for example, "Fighters, 3 o'clock!"[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]Development on B-17 Bomber began in 1981, when              John Sohl was tasked with creating a game based on one of three concepts that utilized the Intellivoice module. While other programmers worked on          Space Spartans and         Bomb Squad, Sohl had the responsibility of making an exciting game based on air traffic controllers. Thankfully, the idea quickly evolved into B-17 Bomber once artist             Bob Del Principe suggested turning the plane into a bomber flying over Europe.By 1982, Sohl created an initial version of the game -- albeit too big for a cartridge and without solid gameplay mechanics. To help with paring and refining the game,            Steve Roney and           William Fisher were added to development upon completing Space Spartans. However, the game was still well behind schedule and undeveloped, and many of Mattel Electronic's staff had to participate in the game's development in the final weeks to ensure it shipped on time. On the last day of development, when the game absolutely had to be shipped to the cartridge manufacturers, a random visitor to Mattel was roped into playing the game for thirty minutes, which ended up being the only stint of game testing B-17 Bomber received. With the short test successful, the code was shipped off to manufacturers on April 23, 1982, and released shortly thereafter. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game starts with the player selecting one of six difficulty levels. The easiest difficulty is a practice level, giving the player 200 bombs to play with and easy enemy defenses. The second level of difficulty starts the player off with an initial payload of 10 bombs, with similarly easy enemy defenses. Each successive difficulty level decreases the initial payload by two bombs and increases the enemy defenses, so the toughest difficulty, level six, gives the player an initial payload of two bombs and extremely tough enemy defenses.  Navigation Map of Europe     From here, the player is given a map of Europe, including a number of potential targets. Any bombing target can be previewed, which will give a close-up view of the target and the points it is worth. The player then selects a destination, which does not have to be their intended target, and prepares for take-off. The destination can be changed mid-flight. The player can also add bombs to their payload before leaving England, but each additional bomb costs its weight in fuel, meaning the maximum bomb load of 17 (outside of practice) will likely leave the bomber without enough fuel to reach most (if any) targets.Once the player is ready to take-off, they will accelerate the B-17 to 90 MPH, and take to the air. The cockpit view shows the horizon, with blue or green below the horizon depending on whether the plane is above sea or land. The navigation map can also be brought up to see progress towards the target, or to assign a new destination. This 90 MPH speed is rather important, as falling below it will cause the bomber to stall.  Fighting Enemy Fighters     As the bomber gets further away from England, it will face enemy fighter pilots that will attempt to shoot it down. As these fighters approach, the game will announce both their presence and location; for example, "Bandits, 9 o'clock!" The player must switch to the proper gun mount and attempt to shoot the enemy fighters down, or they will damage the B-17. Fighters can also damage the gun ports on the player's bomber, rendering them unusable for the remainder of the flight. Anti-aircraft batteries will also fire flak at the bomber once it is over land, which may damage the B-17 and its bomb targeting sights. The only way to avoid flak is through evasive maneuvers, such as changing air speed, altitude, or banking the plane left or right.Once the bomber is nearly over its intended target, the player should switch to the bomb bay view, which will give them a top-down view of the ground. The game will notify the player of the target once it appears by saying, "Target in sight!" The player then aims the bombsights and attempts to hit the target. This may be especially difficult if anti-aircraft batteries have damaged the bombsights, which will cause the crosshair to disappear.When the target has been hit, the fuel load is low, or the plane is too damaged to safely continue, the player should turn back to England. The game will automatically land the B-17 when it crosses England's coastline. Returning to England repairs any damage, and allows the pilot to choose a different payload if desired. However, on the next flight, both the enemy fighters and anti-aircraft batteries will be more difficult to contend with.The game ends when the plane crashes by receiving too much damage, running out of fuel, or pilot error.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Players score points by successfully bombing targets, shooting down enemy fighters, and successfully completing missions. Some categories of targets vary in point value, generally based on their importance or distance inland, which make them harder to reach from the England airbase.Anti-Aircraft Batteries: 1 pointAirports: 5 pointsFactories: 20 to 100 points, depending on distance inlandShips: 5 to 40 points, depending on sizeEnemy Fighters: 2 points eachCompleting a mission earns bonus pointsDropping bombs on England results in a heavy score penalty that is typically more than enough to negate any points earned.

				<plot>Major League Baseball is an action baseball game for two players. The game follows most professional baseball rules and allows you to control all of the players on the team. You can throw a variety of pitches (from curve balls to fast balls), steal bases, tag players out, bunt, try for a home run, and in the event of a tie the game goes into extra innings! Several difficulty levels are available which control the game speed and whether or not stealing bases is allowed.</plot>

				<plot>NBA Basketball is an early, very basic basketball game.  While officially licensed by the NBA, the game contains no team names or players to speak of.  There are only two teams, a Home team and a Visitor team.  The Home team is red and the Visitor team is green.  [CR]The game is shown from a side-court angle with team baskets on the left and right sides of the screen.  Characters animate when running, and when dribbling the basketball.  The "floor" does have basic basketball set-up including the center line and free throw lines.  [CR]NBA Basketball is a two-player (only) game and features four quarters, passing, blocking and jump shots.  There is even overtime should it become necessary.[CR]The title screen says only "Basketball," but the box and game cartridge have the NBA emblem and "NBA Basketball" printed on them.</plot>

				<plot>A vast beam matrix has enshrouded the Earth. This glowing blue grid forms the Restrictor Shield, 99 sectors deep and teeming with hostile alien life. Your mission is to move through all sectors, destroying the enemy craft as you progress. Deeper sectors reveal new enemy types, each with their own method of impeding your success.The player's ship can only move left and right, travelling along one of five beams as the blue beam matrix scrolls towards them. The ship is armed a laser lariat and torpedoes, with the laser being the principle weapon. When the fire button is pressed, the laser will shoot along the beam the player is currently on. The main aim is to destroy all white saucers in a sector, causing the Sector Sentinel to appear. This can only be destroyed with a torpedo &#8211; three are given to the player at the start of each sector &#8211; and a successful hit awards bonus points before play progresses to the next sector.  [CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]  White Enemy Saucers      These are the main enemies you'll encounter. There are 15 in each sector, and you'll need to blast every one of them before you can progress. Saucers change up their attack pattern every few sectors e.g. dodging from left to right while spewing a string of bombs, or simply flying towards your ship in an attempt to ram you. Once you've destroyed all of the saucers in a sector a Sentinel craft will appear, giving you a chance to destroy it. Saucers appear from Sector 1.  Brown Space Debris      This rock-hard refuse will fly in a straight line down a beam at you. Normal laser fire will not damage it, so it can be avoided or destroyed with one of the three torpedoes you are given at the start of each life. Space debris starts appearing from Sector 2 onwards.    Yellow Chirper Ships      These mouthy aliens will announce their arrival with a twin-trill alert. They will then fly horizontally from one side of the screen to the other. Chirpers do not fire at your ship, and cannot collide with it. As such, they serve merely to provide bonus points for any player with a quick trigger finger. Chirpers start appearing from Sector 4.  Green Blocker Ships         Nigh-indestructible enemies that will streak in from the side of the screen, locking onto the beam that your ship is travelling down before trying to ram you. They must then either be avoided or destroyed with a torpedo, as they are impervious to regular laser fire. Although blockers can appear while clearing a sector of white saucers, they predominantly show up to protect a Sector Sentinel. On later levels, more and more green blockers will assault your craft, attempting to thwart any effort to blow up the Sentinel by blocking your torpedoes and causing you to switch beams to get a clear shot. Blockers start appearing as regular enemies from Sector 6.  Green Bounce Craft      This rotund enemy comes from the side of the screen and bounces horizontally across from one beam to the next, hoping to land on your ship to destroy it. If it is unsuccessful, it will bounce off the opposite side of the screen to return at another random interval. Regular lasers cannot harm it, so shoot it with a torpedo or try not to be on the beam it bounces on. Green bouncers appear from Sector 7.Blue Chargers      Chargers will zip down the screen at you along a random beam. They have two methods of attack, depending on what beam your ship is travelling on. If you're on the same beam as a charger when it reaches the bottom of the screen, it will collide with your ship and destroy it. If you're not on the same beam, the charger will wait for a few seconds before leaving the screen. During this small pause there is a chance that you will move sideways and onto the beam where the stationary charger is lurking, resulting in your death. While they aren't actually destroyed by your laser, firing a quick shot up the beam will cause a charger to bounce backwards into the distance from where it came. Chargers begin to appear from Sector 10.Orange Trackers      These devilish ships will track onto the beam your ship is flying along and attempt to ram you. Unlike green blockers, however, trackers will change beams to follow you should you try to avoid them. Initially, they will only change beam once to try and cause a collision. However, the further into the beam matrix you travel, the more intent the trackers will become; soon they will start to change course two or more times in their efforts. Additionally, they are invulnerable to common laser fire, meaning you'll need to be fast to avoid them or see them off with one of your precious torpedoes. Trackers start appearing at Sector 12.Red Zig Bombs      The final enemy to appear is one of the trickiest. Like the chirper, a Zig bomb will make a sound before making its way onscreen. When it does, it will find the beam your ship is on and start to come towards you. Zig bombs cannot be killed outright with regular laser fire, but they can be handled in various ways. If you manage to shoot a Zig bomb with your laser, it will change from red to green. It will then continue its flight down the beam it has chosen, before disappearing off the bottom of the screen. If, for whatever reason, you don't shoot the Zig bomb, it will travel down the beam before performing a last-minute flip across one beam towards your ship. This means if you fail to shoot the Zig, you should ensure that you are at least two beams away from it before it leaves the screen. Of course, the third method of taking a Zig out is to blast it with a torpedo. Zig bombs will appear from Sector 14 onwards.Sector Sentinel      Once all of the white saucers in a sector have been eliminated, an alarm will sound. The Sector Sentinel will then slide into view from either side of the screen. It will continue across the beam matrix horizon until it is either destroyed or leaves on the side opposite its starting position. During its migration, you can attempt to bring it down with any torpedoes you have in your stock. The higher the sector number, the more green blockers will flood onto the screen to prevent the Sentinel from being destroyed. A successful hit will cause the Sentinel to explode and bonus points are given depending on the number of lives you have accrued. Whether or not you destroy a Sentinel, the sector has been cleared and you move onto the next one. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Object of Body Slam: Super Pro Wrestling is to defeat your opponent in the ring. You must use strength, strategy, and a hint of sneakiness. Each match consists of a series of four-minute rounds. There is an unlimited number of rounds, so the match continues until a player wins or until a draw is declared. The first wrestler to pin his opponent to the mat for a time of 3 seconds is the winner.[CR]You control a wrestler selected from 12 different characters. Your [CR]opponent is controlled by another player or by the computer. If [CR]you choose a Tag-Team Match you and your opponent each [CR]control 2 wrestlers who take turns in the ring.[CR]There are 26 possible moves - drops, kicks, punches, etc. Before each match, you choose 4 to 9 moves (depending upon your selected skill level) that you will use in that match. How many moves you can make during the match is determined by your selected skill level: the lower the skill level, the fewer the moves. Players may select different skill levels to handicap the match. The 12 wrestlers you have to choose from, have their relative strengths and weaknesses depending from their height, weight, strength, coordination, and ego.</plot>

				<title_clean>Bomb Squad</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In Bomb Squad, players have to defuse a bomb planted by the nefarious Boris, whose actions threaten to blow up the entire city. While the player is not particularly adept at defusing bombs, they can succeed by following the instructions of demolitions expert Frank and applying logic to determine the correct disarm code.Bomb Squad is one of only a few games to make use of the Intellivoice voice synthesis module. The Intellivoice is used for Frank's instructions, occasional encouragement, and frequent taunting from Boris.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]At the start of Bomb Squad, the city skyline is shown, and the player selects the difficulty and number of code digits on the bomb. The difficulty can be one of three levels, which affects the speed of movement, the complexity of defusing, and the amount of hazard involved. The number of code digits required for defusing the bomb can be between one and three digits.The game then begins, and a thirty minute bomb timer begins to count down. Each code digit is a 4x5 block of circuit boards, and how many of these the player sees in total will depend on how many code digits were selected at the beginning of the game. Circuit BoardsThe player selects one of the circuit boards, and the view switches to a close-up of that board. At this point, demolitions expert Frank will speak up, and tell the player whether they will be cutting or replacing pieces on the current board, and the order the components should be handled. This is a specific sequence of two to five components, depending on difficulty level; for example, "Cut this piece out first, third, and second," as each of the three components Frank is referring to flash. The player can choose to have Frank repeat himself at any time if the instructions were not clear. The circuit board screen, as a component is cut     To succeed on a circuit board, each component must be handled in the order specified by Frank. Regardless of whether cutting or replacing is the task at hand, the player begins by taking out the cutters and trimming the wires connecting the component to the board. Pliers are then used to grab the component and drag it off the board, where it is discarded. From here, if the instructions said to cut pieces, the player simply needs to replace the component with a piece of wire (a rectangular grey piece) by grabbing it from the top of the screen, dropping it in place with the pliers, and attaching the sides with a soldering gun before continuing on to the next component.However, if the instructions said to replace the pieces, the player will need to replace the discarded component with a piece of either the same shape or the same color, using the replacement pieces shown at the top of the screen. This varies for each board, but the rule remains consistent for all components on the board. For example, if the same shape component worked for replacing the first piece, then all subsequent pieces on the current board should be replaced with pieces of the same shape. The new piece will need to be dropped in place by pliers and attached to the board using the soldering gun. In the event more than one piece is a valid replacement, the player will need to experiment with guesswork, and attaching an incorrect piece will require the process to be repeated (see Hazards below).In the event the player is not properly aligning the cutters, the pliers, or the soldering gun while working, Frank will chime in on which direction the tool needs to move; for example, "Right more." Once a board is completed, the pieces at the top will disappear, and Frank will congratulate the player. At this point, it is possible to exit back out to the code digit display. Defusing the BombAs these boards are completed, they will turn either grey or green as they reveal pieces of the code digit, a number 0-9.    Two digits solved, with the third digit completely untouched     Completing all twenty boards in the block for a digit would be both time-consuming and wasteful, and is ill-advised. A far more effective tactic involves tackling only the boards necessary to determine the number hidden behind the code block through process of elimination, and then successfully guessing the number to reveal the entire block. Guessing becomes available after two boards in a block have been successfully completed, or in the final 15 seconds of the bomb's timer in what is called a final "one shot guess."If the player can complete enough boards to correctly guess all the digits for the bomb's disarm code, or succeeds at guessing the disarm code during the "one shot guess" period, the bomb is defused and the city is saved. In the event the timer runs down completely, or the player incorrectly guesses a code digit, the bomb will explode, decimating much of the city, and the game will be over.HazardsThere are numerous hazards or mistakes that can occur during the game which will either hamper the player's progress, or in severe cases, cause the bomb to explode.The most basic error involves connecting an improper component piece to a circuit board or dropping a piece in the wrong place on the board. When this happens, the bomb timer will turn yellow and count down much faster, as the music becomes more frantic. To stop this, the piece must either be disconnected from the board with cutters or picked back up with pliers.Attempting to cut or replace a piece in the wrong order is a more serious error that requires immediate re-soldering to fix the connection. Failure to re-solder the piece within seven or eight seconds on level 1 or 2 difficulty will cause the circuit board to short out, rendering it useless and kicking the player back out to the code digit screen. On level 3 difficulty, failure to fix a piece within nine seconds will cause the bomb to explode and end the game.On difficulty levels 2 and 3, circuit board fires may occasionally occur, as a component piece flashes and begins to overheat. When this happens, the fire extinguisher must be brought out and sprayed at the flashing component. Failure to extinguish the overheating component within eight seconds on level 2 difficulty will cause the circuit board to short out, rendering it useless. On level 3, not extinguishing a flashing piece within nine seconds causes the bomb to explode, ending the game.Level 3 difficulty also has the nasty surprise of a shaking screen, which may occasionally dislodge replacement pieces from the top of the screen and drop them onto the circuit board. It is necessary to remove these pieces to continue unhampered.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Points are earned for working successfully with components, circuit boards, and by figuring out the bomb's disarm code.Properly removing a component: 20 pointsProperly replacing a component: 30-50 points, depending on skill levelRepairing a circuit board: Double all points earned working on the boardCorrectly guessing a code digit: 1000 pointsDefusing the bomb: 2000 points[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Bump 'n' Jump</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bump 'N' Jump started as an arcade game developed by Data East, which was licensed to Bally Midway for its use in 1982. Its popularity spawned several console ports, the last being an NES version in 1988.In Bump 'N' Jump, players drive a red car down an open road at up to 220 MPH (or km/h in some versions). The main objective is to reach the gas station at the end of each roadway without crashing into obstacles, trees, or water. The road is filled with traffic of both light and heavy cars and trucks, some of which attempt to take the player's car out by bumping into it and sending it skidding to the side. Points are earned for progress made down the road, as well as bumping into other cars and sending them skidding off the road or into obstacles.A warning sign to jump. Jump! Once the player's car reaches 100 MPH, the car can jump high into the air. Around 40-50 MPH in speed will be lost by a single jump, so players will need to use some strategy to decide when it is most advantageous to utilize jumping. Jumping can come in handy to avoid skidding off the road when bumped, and also for avoiding patches of heavy traffic. Landing on enemy cars will destroy them and earn points.Countless broken bridges, water, slight curves, and splits also pose problems along the road. Well-timed jumps are often the only way to clear some obstacles such as broken bridges, and also are the easiest way to clear most water hazards. Because timing is essential for clearing major hazards, a warning beep sounds and a "!" will appear at the top of the screen when a hazard requiring a jump is imminent (though some hazards may still have safe causeways on one side). Landing on islands in the middle of water or bridge hazards will earn bonus points.At the end of a roadway, the number of enemy cars taken out is added to the player's score as bonus points, usually 300 to 500 points per car. In the event no enemies were crashed during the roadway, a significantly large bonus of 50,000 points will be awarded.As with most retro games, the game ends once the player exhausts all their lives.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Roadways in Bump 'N' Jump are based off seasons. Once a player completes the first roadway, they start a Spring stage, then progress to a Summer stage, and so on, moving and repeating through all the seasons. The colors in these stages reflect their represented season, and offer little other change beyond increasing difficulty.The variation of roadways varies between versions. In the arcade version, after the first three roads, the game begins a cycle of five roadways in order, repeating indefinitely until game over. The Intellivision version claims to have 32 unique roadways, while the Atari 2600 version has only eight (perhaps in the same manner as the arcade version).[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Differentiating every type of enemy car can be difficult, especially in console versions with lower detailed graphics. For the sake of simplicity, it is best to assume that any cars not mentioned here are light, may weave back and forth on the road in a non-hostile manner, and will skid a long way if hit.The more important cars to watch for are listed below.TractorThe tractor is often mistaken as a tank by players, as it has large treads and a dark green appearance in some console versions. The tractor drives in a straight line, and is extremely slow and easy to pass. Bumping a heavy tractor will barely budge it, and will send the player skidding further than usual. For this reason, caution should be used when passing tractors on narrow sections of road.Skull CarOne skull car and two dump trucks.The skull car is obvious in appearance, as it has a large skull and crossbones on its roof. When the players gets near a skull car, it will usually move toward the player, attempting to bump them off the road and generally get in the way. While this is far more dangerous in writing than in practice, poorly-timed encounters with a skull car can cause bumping that slows a player down at a crucial moment, ruining a necessary jump. The same warning applies to narrow roads and splits, especially when trying to navigate around other vehicles.Dump TruckArguably the most dangerous enemy in the game, the dump truck often moves faster than the player's top speed, and will dump out piles of debris that can crash the player if hit. Dump trucks only move in a straight line, and often must be watched closely while engaging other traffic. Simply touching a dump truck will destroy it -- an important fact to keep in mind if shooting for the 50,000 point no-kill bonus.During the first roadway, and select seasons afterwards (depending on version), the dump truck will make its dumping animation, but won't actually dump any debris onto the road.White CarThe white car is not as aggressive as the skull car, but will move towards the player and attempt to interfere upon approach. As with the skull car, care must be taken to avoid letting the white car botch jump speed and timing.Yellow TruckIn more graphically detailed versions, this truck may be blue with a yellow front. Otherwise, it looks like a pure yellow heavy-duty dump truck. The yellow truck is appropriately heavy, much like the tractor, but also weaves across the road frequently, making it tougher to simply dodge.[CR][B]Difficulty:[/B][CR]While Bump 'N' Jump is not a difficult game to learn by any means, its difficulty varies from system to system. Successfully completing roadways often necessitates rote memorization, as the top-down view makes knowledge of upcoming splits and twists in hazards impossible. This is especially true in later stages, where the player may be required to time landings on small islands in the middle of hazards before jumping again, without knowing what speed is necessary to hit the island.Some versions of the game are also stingy in handing out lives. The Intellivision version only explicitly promises one extra life at 20,000 points, and makes no mention of other opportunities for extra lives. In the arcade and Atari 2600 versions, where extra lives are awarded every 30,000 points, the best way to maintain a healthy supply of lives is by earning the 50,000 no-kill bonus as often as possible.[CR]NES version[CR]The NES version of Bump 'N' Jump came out in 1988, far later than earlier versions, and exhibits significant differences over its predecessors in both difficulty and storyline.A plot is added in which the protagonist's girlfriend has been kidnapped by generic thugs, who he pursues over 16 stages. The seasons concept is thrown out for a more diversely themed set of stages, featuring cityscapes, beaches, and cliffsides. Some stages also contain bonus air targets, which can be hit at the peak of a jump.The difficulty for this version is also much higher, with only three lives available to start and very high score thresholds to attain extra lives. In addition, P-fuel cells need to be gathered along the road, in order to keep a rapidly-depleting fuel tank full. Running out of fuel costs a life, which makes the process of surviving all the more bothersome. A few recharge stations can be entered in certain stages throughout the game, which starts a lengthy button mashing bonus sequence to regain P-fuel.Upon reaching the end of stage 16, the player engages in a boss fight with the enemy car carrying his girlfriend. Running out of P-fuel here does not kill the player, but renders them unable to jump regardless of speed. After the boss is jumped on enough times and destroyed, a cutscene plays, and the 16 stages begin all over again.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Title screen.Burgertime is an Arcade game originally released in 1982. A single-screen platformer game, the stages are a series of platforms with sections that are made of components of a mighty hamburger. These ingredients are placed in the level vertically so that, as the player character walked across them, they would drop until eventually making a complete sandwich at the bottom of the screen. The finished burgers are such titans that it dwarfs the player character. Of note, the servers who would carry this burger to the customers are never shown.The player controls Peter Pepper, a chef whose objective is to walk, climb and scurry all over the platforms in order to build his burgers. As the chef walks completely across the top of a layer, it will drops one level below, thus knocking the layer beneath down one level also. After all the layers have been dropped onto the platters awaiting below, the burger is complete and the player's score is boosted. When all hamburgers are completed, only then is the level clear. As with most of the games of the time, the levels become more complex and difficult as the player progresses. This is accomplished through varied platform layouts, more enemies, and an ever-increasing number of burger components. Just like in real life, no-one orders a plain cheeseburger forever. While the chef fights to keep his customers fed and happy, he is besieged by three malcontents of the food industry: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle and Mr. Egg. These 3 can be killed temporarily by dropping a layer of the burger on top of them but it is a short-term solution as they reappear at the edge of the screen after a short time. A crafty chef can also make the fiends chase him across a partially walked across layer and then complete it as the enemy steps on to it. The layer will then drop along with the enemy whose weight causes it to drop two levels as opposed to just one. An added benefit to this technique is that it temporarily stuns the enemy. It's possible to crush other enemies beneath the falling enemy and burger as well. Peter Pepper also has a small supply of pepper he can throw in the enemies face to render them harmless for a few seconds. Additional pepper can be acquired by picking up ice cream and other items that will randomly spawn on the level.PizzaTime, the hotly anticipated sequel was in development when the video game market went into a decline, and sadly was never released.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Buzz Bombers is an arcade action game similar to Centipede. You control a can of bug spray at the bottom of the screen, and you need to defend yourself from the swarms of incoming bees. The bees start at the top of the screen, and fly their way back and forth, slowly heading towards the bottom of the screen. If they reach the ground, they will pollinate the flowers there which causes them to grow and will restrict movement of your spray can. When you shoot a bee, it will turn into a honeycomb. The honeycombs will cause the bees to head towards the ground even faster, since they will turn around when one is in their way. Your spray can is able to shoot the honeycombs, but if you leave them in place a hummingbird will fly around and eat the honey from them. The more honey the hummingbird eats, the more points you get. The game ends when all of your spray cans are destroyed by growing flowers.</plot>

Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the various targets before you run out of bullets. In addition to the assorted targets that float by, there are boxes which can be shot to earn additional bullets. You also need to be careful of the ducks! From time to time, a duck will fly down and eat some of your bullets if you don't shoot it first. You move on to the next round of gameplay when the rack has been cleared of all the targets, and the game ends when you use up all of your bullets.</plot>

				<plot>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. [CR]The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. [CR]Insect Opponents and Mushrooms[CR]All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:[CR]1. The Centipede[CR]The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.[CR]Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.[CR]The Spider[CR]The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.[CR]The Flea[CR]The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.[CR]The Scorpion[CR]The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.[CR]Mushrooms[CR]Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.[CR]Game Difficulty and Variations[CR]The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:[CR]1. One Player[CR]Two Player Alternating[CR]Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.[CR]Dual Player Competition[CR]Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.[CR]Team Play[CR]Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:[CR]Centipede Head - 100 points[CR]Centipede Body Segment - 10 points[CR]Spider at close range - 900 points[CR]Spider at medium range - 600 points[CR]Flea - 200 points[CR]Scorpion - 1,000 points[CR]Flea - 200 points[CR]Restored mushroom - 5 points[CR]Destroyed mushroom - 1 points</plot>

				<plot>You can play alone, against your Intellivision unit or with another player either in singles or in doubles. You can even let your Intellivision take both sides and just watch. Maybe you'll see some weakness. [CR]Go ahead conquer Paris, New York, and Wimbledon if you can. You will need both great concentration and strong legs to win at Championship Tennis. Play locations such as Flushing Meadows, Roland Garros, Wimbledon. In Championship Tennis you are in charge. See if you have what it takes to win the "grand slam"! [CR]Championship Tennis is an advanced version of the original, successful Intellivision Tennis. You will feel the tension and excitement of some of the great courts in the world, as you serve deep to your opponent's backhand and return a lob with a smashing overhead, just out of reach of your opponent's outstretched racquet. It will require skill, dexterity, cunning and wits along with plenty of practice to master Championship Tennis. [CR][CR]DEVELOPMENT HISTORY:[CR]As with World Championship Soccer, this is a Dextell release we are including here since it received its US debut in the INTV Corp. catalog. And also like World Championship Soccer, it is a Blue Sky Rangers game. [CR]Championship Tennis was started at Mattel Electronics to be a one- to four-player game for the Entertainment Computer System (ECS). Ray Kaestner (BurgerTime) started working on the game briefly at Mattel Electronics headquarters in California, but when he was put on Masters of the Universe II, Doubles Tennis was sent to the French office. [CR]A very preliminary version of the cartridge was shown at the January 1984 Consumer Electronics Show. As with World Cup Soccer, when Mattel Electronics closed, the rights to the unfinished game were given to Nice Ideas, the company formed from the French office. [CR]Nice Ideas completed the cartridge as a one- or two- (or zero-) player non-ECS game and it was released in Europe by Dextell Ltd. INTV Corp. negotiated the rights to distribute the cartridge in the United States, introducing it in Spring 1986. [CR]http://www.intellivisionlives.com/gamepage.php?gameId=20[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Checkers is a simplistic board game simulation released for the Intellivision in 1979. Based off of the popular board game, Checkers was published by Mattel Electronics and developed by APh Technological Consulting. The game was released as Draughts in England, reflecting its common name in that territory. Checkers was later included on two separate Intellivision collections: A Collection of Classic Games from the Intellivision (PlayStation) and Intellivision Lives! (Various). [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR] The calm before the storm...     As per the board game, Checkers is played on a 64-square playing field, where each player controls 12 individual colored pieces. Checkers prompts players to select a piece, move a piece, and react to computer controlled moves. Captured pieces appear to the right and left of the playing field, depending on color. The game can also be played player vs. player, rather than player vs. computer.  There are several other features that Checkers boasts, including varying levels of difficult (either high or low), control over which player goes first, computer suggested moves (through the "computer suggests move" option), and even the ability to undo player enacted moves.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Outnumbered and outgunned, the player controls commando Joseph "Super Joe" Gibson. His job is to blast his way through levels filled with paramilitary scum and save the hostages, using only a few grenades and his trusty rifle. Some will run at Joe, guns blazing, while others will be smart enough to hide from him. The maps are varied with trees, rivers, and bridges, and grenades can be found scattered around the map.Beating the main sequence will loop the game back around to the beginning in the style of the classic Arcade.[CR]Version Differences[CR]The NES version of Commando contains several secret rooms that weren't found in the Arcade original. It was the first Capcom NES conversion that they themselves performed, rather than giving it to developers-for-hire Micronics to handle as had been the case with their previous NES games. As such, the NES version of Commando might be seen as Capcom's first foray into console game development.The Atari 7800 version was produced by Sculptured Software under license from Data East USA. It contains weapon power-ups, such as a rapid-fire rifle.The Commodore 64 version features different music by Rob Hubbard. The C64 music was later referenced in a track on the Bionic Commando Rearmed soundtrack. A hacker group known as DSE produced a bootleg sequel (which they called "Commando: The Second Version") by hacking new levels into the game. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] One levels plays very much like Donkey KongCongo Bongo was first created by    Sega to compete with arcade games such as   Donkey Kong or  Frogger. It never found the success of Donkey Kong and Frogger, and it was very much a commercial failure. Despite its lack of success in the arcades, it was eventually ported to most home computers and game home consoles.     [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] Bongo is a mischievous ape that sets the tent of safari hunter on fire. The safari hunter lost his tent and possessions, and he seeks revenge on the ape for his practical joke. The safari hunter chases Bongo and through the dangerous Congo to get his revenge. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR] Rhinos, one of the many dangers in the CongoCongo Bongo takes place in an isometric perspective, and requires the player to move a safari hunter through for different levels. One level, that resembles Donkey Kong, has the hunter climbing a mountain while simultaneously avoiding coconuts that a gorilla is hurling its way. Two levels have that hunter moving through a level avoiding hippos and rhinos. The last level very much resembles frogger, and has the hunter crossing a river across logs and lily pads.  These four levels will loop until the player loses all their lives.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Defender is a  side scrolling shoot 'em up, and one one of the first space shooters to feature the freedom to move left or right. Gameplay[CR]The player flies left or right looking for UFOs to shoot. An HUD located on the top of the screen indicates where the UFOs are located; the goal is to achieve as many points as possible.Defender has a wrap-around landscape, and that landscape contains as many as ten humanoids. Alien ships called Landers attempt to abduct these humanoids. If a Lander grabs a humanoid and carries it up to the top of the screen, the Lander and humanoid merge into a much more aggressive Mutant ship. If all of the humanoids are killed, the land at the bottom of the screen explodes and the player must fight in empty space. At this point, all the Landers become Mutants. Every fifth wave restores the humanoid count to ten, regenerating the planetary surface, if necessary.Defender had a fairly complicated control scheme for the time, with a lever for moving up and down and buttons for thrust, fire, reverse, smart bomb, and hyperspace. Most ports and even some emulated versions of Defender replace the thrust and reverse buttons in favor of a four-way joystick to control movement and direction.The game was programmed by  Eugene Jarvis and  Larry DeMar, who would later go on to form an external development company known as Vid Kidz.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Screenshot from Demon Attack Demon Attack is an early shoot 'em up where the player must defeat waves of aliens with a laser cannon. Unlike other early shooting games such as Space Invaders, Demon Attack does not give the player obstacles with which to hide from enemy attack. Also, compared to Space Invader-type games, there are fewer aliens on screen at any given time but the alien sprites are bigger and more elaborate. The cannon also moves much faster, and has a smaller hitbox making it easier to evade enemy fire. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]First level of the Atari 2600 version.The player controls a single cannon at the bottom of the screen which can move left and right. Up to three Demons will warp into existence and float around, with the lowest Demon dropping missiles. Destroying a Demon will cause a new one to warp in until the end of the combat wave, at which point destroying the remaining Demons will clear the stage.As the stages progress, the aliens become faster and change appearance, and some will split in half when struck instead of being destroyed. If one half of the lowest Demon is destroyed, the other half will fly down towards the cannon in a kamikaze run. Thanks to its small size, it can be difficult to hit before it reaches the ground, though it can be evaded if there is enough room to the side. Once both halves are destroyed, the middle Demon will float down to take the place of the lowest, and if one half is destroyed the remaining half will immediately fly down towards the cannon. Later demons also drop missiles that follow them, letting them sweep their fire across an area when they move.The first run of cartridges stopped gameplay after the 84th wave, supposedly by design. Every run of the cartridges thereafter allows the player to 'wrap' the score and gameplay continues until all lives are lost, though the difficulty does not increase.[CR]Variations[CR]There two multiplayer modes - first, alternating play stage-by-stage to compete for score, and second, co-operative play with the cannon changing color to represent the controls switching between first and second player at pre-set intervals.The other option allows the cannon's shots to be guided by the motion of the cannon itself, much like the attacks of the later Demons.[CR]Legal Complications[CR]Atari itself filed a lawsuit against Imagic, claiming it was too similar to  Phoenix. Imagic and Atari settled out-of-court, and Demon Attack went on to sell well.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]  View zoomed image in  gallery for animation.     You play as Dig Dug (who is also known as    Taizo Hori in other games that he appears in), a  pump wielding spelunker who faces several enemies while he digs    underground. The object of each level (or board) is to clear it of all of the enemies before they kill you by walking to within a set distance and pushing the button to fill the up with air until they explode. Another more strategic way to dispatch your enemies would be to dig underneath    boulders that are located on each level and drop them on to to enemies that are below them. It could be argued that this was one of the first major acts of  violence  in a video game, but due to it's cartoon like nature it was probably overlooked at the time. The original game was released into arcades by Namco in 1982, and contained the standard (at the time) of 256 levels before you reached a    "kill screen" and the game either froze up or  reset itself. Another source of scoring points throughout the game is the inclusion of a fruit or item in the center of the screen that would appear after dropping two of the levels boulders. This mechanic is very similar to another Namco game series,    Pac-Man. The boulders did not have to drop on enemies for the fruits to appear however. The bonus items include :    Carrot,  Turnip, Zucchini (or Cucumber),    Eggplant,  Green Pepper,    Tomato,    Garlic,    Watermelon,    Pineapple, as well as the inclusion of a  Warship from Namco's    Galaxian.     [CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]PookaPooka: Best described as a round orange ball with aviator goggles, Pooka is the most common enemy that you will  face in the game. Not as overly aggressive as his counter part, he as well as Fygar still has the ability to pass through  the un-dug parts of the dirt in each level to attack you from any angle.  FygarFygar: A dragon-like creature, not only can he pass through the dirt and attack you but also has the ability to breathe fire, making him a decidedly more difficult and deadly enemy.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Dig-Dug is considered to be a classic and has spawned many    sequels and has appeared on many    compilations and game download services since its initial release. The character of DIg-Dug also has a son named Susumu Hori ( that appears in the    Mr. Driller series), continuing the family legacy of digging to the depths of the earth.  Downloading and playing the demo of the XBLA version unlocks a Gamerpic. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Boy version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game scores of 6,6,6, and 5.  They stated, "...the game play is intact and the graphics are decent for GB standards.  A few new features [are] thrown in for a little variety and you have a solid little GB cart that's great for long road trips".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Peter Pepper has taken up a job at a local diner. Unfortunately, the Rotten Food has followed him there, and is scattering meals all over the place. Peter must navigate the diner and kick all the balls of food back onto their respective plates, while avoiding being tackled by the Rotten Food.[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]Diner was created from a prototype of a Masters of the Universe game. This reworking was influenced by game sales, as BurgerTime was selling far better than the original Masters of the Universe cartridge. While Diner was billed as the sequel to BurgerTime, and used the BurgerTime name and characters under license from Data East, it is considered an unofficial sequel at best, and has not seen the light of day since its initial release on the Intellivision in 1987.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In a game of Diner, Peter Pepper starts with six lives, or turns. Players run around the series of ladders, stairs, and platforms with Peter, kicking food balls so that they roll towards the plate at the bottom of the screen. If a food ball is currently rolling, it must stop before Peter can kick another food ball. In addition, Peter freezes for a second while kicking, so it's advisable not to be too close to a pursuing Rotten while doing this.If a Rotten Food tackles Peter, he loses a turn. since the playing field is pseudo-3D, there is some leeway to dodging nearby Rottens by running around them, but this can be risky due to questionable hit detection.In the event Peter is cornered or otherwise needs to escape, he can use dashes of pepper, much like in BurgerTime, to freeze nearby enemies for a few seconds. Extra dashes of pepper can be earned by grabbing bonus side orders that appear once in a while in a set spot in each room.Some levels will have holes which open and close at set intervals; if Peter is above a hole as it opens, he loses a turn. Other levels will have rising and falling platforms, which can be used by enemies as well as Peter.Once a plate is complete, Peter Pepper pauses to celebrate, and then the screen scrolls right to the next room. After the completion of every fourth room, instead of celebration, all the Rottens disappear and a bonus round begins. Bonus food balls will roll straight down the platforms, and points are scored for each ball grabbed. However, grabbing a flashing ball will immediately end the bonus round and cost a turn. The amount of balls in the bonus round is determined by how many side orders Peter Pepper grabbed in the last four rooms.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]While the hot dogs return as part of the Rotten Food gang, every other enemy is brand new for Diner. This includes bananas, cherries, and Mugsy, a mug of root beer considered to be the leader of the Rotten Food at the diner.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The diner, called Ray's, is named after Ray Kaestner, who programmed Burgertime and Diner for the Intellivision.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Donkey Kong</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The First LevelThe arcade classic Donkey Kong rose out of Nintendo's desire to crack into the United States arcade market. The company's president back in 1981, Hiroshi Yamauchi, made the decision to take a Nintendo arcade release called Radar Scope (a hit game in Japan that floundered in the States) and see if it could be easily retrofitted to play a different, and hopefully more successful, game. To accomplish this task, Yamauchi chose a young employee named Shigeru Miyamoto.The basic story of the game is that Donkey Kong is Jumpman's pet. Jumpman mistreats Donkey Kong, who snaps and kidnaps Pauline and, in a decidedly King Kong-like twist, takes her up a building under construction. Jumpman must navigate four different levels, climbing to the top to either force Donkey Kong to move on or, in the stunning final confrontation, bring the building's girders down to make the big monkey fall.Donkey Kong was followed-up by Donkey Kong Jr. , which puts the player in the role of Donkey Kong's son, Donkey Kong Jr., who must attempt to rescue his father from the clutches of the evil Jumpman, who by then had already been renamed Mario. [CR]Development[CR]The Second LevelUpon going to work, Miyamoto's first attempt was to make a game based on the then-popular Popeye character. The licensing deal was not pursued by Nintendo, though the company would later secure the license and develop a popular Popeye arcade game. Miyamoto had to retrofit his concept and develop three characters with similar relations to Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Bluto. He came up with a little man with a mustache that was quickly named Jumpman, who had to save his girlfriend, Pauline, from the evil gorilla named Donkey Kong. After designing the concept Miyamoto approached his more colleague Gunpei Yokoi who would assist the young designer by supervising the technical development of the project.Unfortunately due to the technical limitations in place not all of Miyamoto's ideas for the game were able to be included as concepts such as incorporating seesaws into the game or having the characters expressions more defined and animated were unable to be incremented into the game. These technical restrictions would ultimately have an effect on the character design of Jumpman as he was forced to make the character small whilst still making him look human. As such Miyamoto thought it best to give the character distinct features,"such as giving him a big nose. We gave him a moustache so that we didn't need to draw a mouth, as it's often difficult to show facial expressions with small characters. We also gave him big hands."The name Donkey Kong was ultimately the decision of Miyamoto too. Wanting to give the impression of a stubborn, stupid gorilla he thought of animals which he thought were dim-witted and stubborn he came up with the idea of 'Donkey' which he believed to mean stupid. He also wished to incorporate the word 'Kong' into the title which in Japanese gives the idea of apes. Putting the two together the end result was "Donkey Kong". [CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The Final LevelDonkey Kong helped to create the platformer genre, and also was one of the first to include a story. Donkey Kong changed the way people played games; no longer was it just about high scores, gamers began to play the game to find out what would happen next. Donkey Kong became one of the most iconic video games of all-time and a huge part of American pop culture, gaining mentions on countless television shows, songs, and movies. Donkey Kong also essentially launched Nintendo's biggest character of all-time, Mario.As a testament to the legacy of Donkey Kong, the documetary King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters was released in 2007, 26 years after the game's debut. The film was about gamer Steve Wiebe and his journey to defeat Billy Mitchell's high score, which had stood for 25 years. Public awareness about the competition for this score was raised by this film, and in the years since Wiebe, Mitchell, and others have traded positions on the top spot. Read more about the documentary at the official site.In July 2009, Donkey Kong made news yet again when a 26-year-old easter egg, which did nothing more than display the initials of Landon M. Dyer, who worked to code the title, was uncovered after Dyer mentioned that he had forgotten how to display the initials and offered $75 to whomever can find the Easter egg first. The $75 was awarded to Don Hodges after he dug through the game's code and found the way to display the initials.[CR]Donkey Kong: Original Edition[CR]In 2010, a special version of the NES release of Donkey Kong was available to those in Europe who purchased the special Super Mario Bros. 25th anniversary Wii. This version, subtitled "Original Edition", restored the missing "pie factory" stage as well as some animations. Although still not arcade-perfect, it was still much more than any edition released on the NES.This edition of the game would not release in Japan or the United States until 2012, and only then, on the 3DS. In Japan, it was a pre-order bonus for New Super Mario Bros. 2. In The States, it is a bonus gift for players that purchase the digital download versions of Art Academy: Lessons For Everyone!, Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask, Style Savvy: Trendsetters, or Crosswords Plus before January 6, 2013. It was made available to everyone for purchase on the European 3DS eShop on September 18, 2014.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The first console port was licensed by Nintendo but not made by them. A near perfect arcade port, and pack-in, was created for the ColecoVision system. This propelled its sales over the Atari 5200 and sold 500,000 units at launch. Over a year later Coleco made a version for its rival's Atari 2600. Sega was also planning to release a version with Coleco.Falcon was licensed to distribute the game in Europe, which it did so with modified graphics and the name "Crazy Kong" (this is often mistaken to be a bootleg game). They did the same with the sequel Donkey Kong Junior, as Crazy Kong Jr./Crazy Junior. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Donkey Kong Jr. Arcade machineDonkey Kong Jr. is the sequel to the 1981 arcade hit, Donkey Kong.This time it's Donkey Kong himself that needs rescuing and Junior has to try his best to work around four screens with themes ranging from jungle to power plant.Mario is using his entire arsenal to keep Junior down in one of his few instances of playing the villain. Junior will encounter everything from birds and bear traps to electricity during his quest. Fortunately he can climb vines to escape and navigate and maybe drop a well-placed object on his enemies' heads.Like its predecessor the game loops around to the beginning every time its four stages are beaten.[CR]Highscores[CR]All scores are from Twin Galaxies, the world authority on player rankings, gaming statistics and championship tournaments, with pinball statistics dating from the 1930s and video game statistics from the early 1970s.RankPointsPlayerDate11,190,400Steve J Wiebe02/14/201021,147,800Mark L Kiehl10/09/200931,033,000Ike Hall08/16/20084957,300Billy L Mitchell03/19/19835953,500Antonio Medina02/06/1983[CR]</plot>

				<plot>As the sun sets, Dracula rises, hungry for the blood of fresh victims.  As Dracula, the goal of this game is to stalk the streets at night, feeding on people walking the streets, or by luring them out of their homes.  As Dracula bites his victims, his actions will call the attention of the local constable who will try to slow him down by driving a stake into him.  Dracula can respond by either turning one of his victims into zombies to attack the police, or by transforming into a bat to escape capture.  Even the forces of nature are against the vampire, as wolves will attack him on foot, and hawks will drag away his bat form.  Dracula must feed on a certain number of victims and return to his tomb before sunrise, or he will not survive to feed another night.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dragonfire is a 1982 Imagic release. The player controls a prince who seeks to recover the king's treasure by stealing it from dragons, all of whom inhabit castles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragonfire consists of two stages:The BridgeThe player must move the prince from the tower at the right side of the screen, across a bridge, and into the left side tower. While crossing, the player must duck under, or jump over fireballs. It is possible to jump while ducking to avoid difficult patterns of fireballs. Once across the bridge, the second stage begins inside the castle and the dragon's lair.The Dragon's LairA dragon moves back and forth, while firing wide versions of fireballs at the prince. To escape, the player must scramble about collecting the randomly placed dragon's treasure for points. Different treasures are worth different amounts of points, and more difficult castles contain more valuable treasure. Once this is done, an exit door will open, and the prince must escape to tackle another castle and another dragon.Each castle is progressively more difficult, with more frequent and faster moving fireballs and dragons. Once the player depletes lives, pressing the fire button will continue the game at the most recent level. Additionally, difficulty switches select the starting difficulty at one of seven levels. Two player alternating play is supported. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Zorban Dreadnaughts are spaceships that are 140,000 feet long and weigh 970 megatons, making them the largest, most heavily armoured spaceships ever created. A fleet of these large battlecraft are now heading towards your home planet, and it is your job to stop them! The game is played from a side scrolling overhead point of view as your small but agile spaceship flies past the dreadnaughts. On each pass your spaceship makes, you need to try and bomb as many of the energy vents as possible. When all energy vents on a dreadnaught are destroyed, that dreadnaught will explode. Time is limited, though, and if you make too many passes to destroy the energy vents the dreadnaught will be within firing range of your home planet and will destroy it. Each of the dreadnaughts are heavily armed; guns, canons, missiles, and other weapons are located on each dreadnaught and will be trying their best to end your mission. Multiple skill levels are included which alter the number of dreadnaughts you must destroy, as well as their speed and firing capabilities.</plot>

				<plot>Math fun is an educational game which can be played by one or two players. Each player controls a gorilla which is wandering through the jungle.  As the gorilla walks on, it will encounter a creature which has a math problem with it. You need to enter in the correct answer to the problem as quickly as possible. If you get the answer correct, your gorilla may continue on. If you get the answer wrong, then your gorilla must jump into the river. Your gorilla is unable to leave the river and continue on until you answer another math problem correctly. The goal is to correctly answer as many of the problems as you can in the shortest amount of time. The game includes eighteen different levels of difficulty which can be set individually for each player.</plot>

				<plot>Word Fun was developed in conjuction with the Children's Television Workshop, and features three different word based educational games. The games are:[CR]Crosswords:[CR] This game is similar to Scrabble. Each player is given seven letters from which they need to form words on the game board. On each turn the player can create words either horizontally or vertically, and must use one (or more) of the existing letters on the board. Points are earned depending on the word created, and at the end of 20 turns the player with the most points wins![CR]Letter Hunt:[CR] In this game each player controls a monkey in a letter forest. Each monkey must collect letters from the forest to spell three words within the given time limit. When both monkeys are complete, points are awarded for the words spelled and the highest score wins![CR]Word Rockets:[CR] In this game the players control a rocket capable of collecting and shooting vowels upwards. On the top of the screen, various words which are missing vowels will float by and each player needs to try to fire an appropriate vowel into the empty space. The first player who can complete 50 words wins!</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fathom is an action-adventure game that allows player to switch control between both a dolphin and a seagull. The game was developed by Rup Fulop, known for his Atari 2600 ports of Missile Command, Atlantis, and other classic titles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players control Proteus, who must rescue Neptina (Neptune's daughter) by taking the form of both a dolphin and a seagull.Players start the game as a dolphin, where they must submerge several screens, avoiding obstacles, and touching seahorses. Doing this helps locate the trident pieces, which are in different locations each level and playthrough.Players then assume the role of the seagull. Flying several screens horizontally reveals clouds and obstacles. The pink clouds are collected which become stars, also helping to locate the remaining trident pieces.After collecting the trident, players must again become the dolphin in order to rescue Neptune's daughter from her undersea cage. Once the game is complete, the player may continue playing at a higher difficulty.[CR]</plot>

There are four difficulty levels; high school, college, semi-pro, and pro. There are nine different plays to call, including running plays, field goals, passing plays, and punting. The only thing that's not realistic about NFL Football is the teams only have five players on offense and on defense.</plot>

				<title_clean>Frog Bog</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Frogs and Flies (on the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64), and Frog Bog (Intellivision) consist of two frogs competing to zap the highest number of flies before time runs out. The play area includes two lily-pads with one frog on each. The grey frog is controlled by player one, and the red frog is controlled by player two, or by the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Intellivision VersionThere are two difficulty modes, the first of which locks the frogs' flight path and landing point. The player simply decides when to leap, and when to zap a fly with the fire button. The tongue takes a moment to fully extend; timing the jump and tongue are the basis of the gameIn the second difficulty mode, the frogs are not locked on to a single flight path. They are free to roam around the lily-pads, which affect the trajectory of the jump. In this mode, a frog can accidentally jump into the water, where the player will lose valuable time swimming back to the pad.Each fly is worth two points, and the highest score wins when the timer runs out. Note that there is no onscreen timer, rather, the day progresses as the sky darkens to night. At the end of the game, a firefly brings out "The End" to the middle of the screen, and a "cricket chirp" sound is played until the game is reset. [CR]Pop Culture References[CR]Frog Bog was referenced in the 2006 Adam Sandler film Grandmas Boy.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Frogger</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Frogger is a top-down, multi-stage action game. The player controls frogs home, while avoiding obstacles. The arcade game's popularity lead to many ports, remakes, and sequels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Frogger about to cross the road.  The objective in Frogger is controlling frogs home using a four-way joystick. Gameplay is timed, and successful completion requires navigating several contiguous stages in each level.First, the frog must cross a highway while avoiding various automobiles. Lanes of traffic operate in alternating directions, and at different speeds. Getting squashed by a vehicle causes the player to lose one life, and restart the level.A median separates the highway from a river. In later stages, the median is occupied by a snake which will also cause the player to lose a life if touched. The river contains alternating lanes of turtles and logs, moving in alternate directions, and at different speeds. The turtles move in groups of two or three, and every other group submerges regularly. The player must navigate over the turtles while above water to reach logs in various configurations, and repeat the process until reaching home.Timing is critical as the player navigates the frog into one of five home slots. Missing the slot, or reaching the edge of the screen before leaping home loses the player one life, and restarts the stage. Once a home slot is filled, the stage restarts, and play resumes until all home slots are filled, causing the next level to start.Score is kept as each frog progresses toward home, points are tallied. Additionally, optional bonus points are gained by rescuing a lady frog atop a log by hopping over her, and bringing her into a home slot without dying. Further bonus points are earned through catching briefly-appearing flies in home slots, and finishing stages early.Later stages present the player with additional challenges from faster moving obstacles, faster submersing turtles, alligators occupying home slots briefly, snakes moving along logs, and trickier log configurations.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The popular 1990s show Seinfeld had an episode almost entirely dedicated to Frogger. In the episode George Costanza learns that a pizza place he visited frequently as a child is closing down which will lead to the unplugging of a Frogger arcade machine and the loss of his high score. At the end of the episode, from a top down view identical to the game, we see George maneuver the arcade cabinet through traffic to reach the other side of the street.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>PGA Golf is a golf game played from an overhead point of view. Up to four players can compete on a nine hole, par 38 course containing a variety of terrain (greens, fairway, rough, water, and sand) as well as numerous trees. Each player has nine clubs (3 woods, 4 irons, a wedge, and a putter) and is able hook, slice, and control the power of each shot. You will receive penalty strokes for balls that land out of bounds and in the water, and of course the lowest score at the end of the round wins!</plot>

				<plot>Happy Trails is an action strategy game for one or two players. Black Bart has robbed the stagecoach, and you need to recover all of the stolen money within the given time limit! The money is located in various locations in a series of maze-like paths. The paths are broken up into tiles, and there is one tile missing so you can rearrange the maze by moving a tile into the empty space. As your character walks through the paths, you need to rearrange the tiles to make sure there is always a connected path in front of him (or you'll lose a life) and to guide him towards the money bags. When all of the money has been recovered, you move on to the next round. On the more difficult rounds, Black Bart will also be wandering around the maze trying to stop you! You should avoid him at all costs, unless you have first collected a star which gives your character temporary invincibility.</plot>

				<plot>NHL Hockey is a two-player, action hockey game for the Intellivision. Players control their team's puck handler, while the CPU controls all other team members, including the goalie. The players can either shoot the puck quickly or pass it slowly, and can also trip other players (at the risk of a penalty if they do not have the puck.) Stealing the puck and intercepting shots are also possible during gameplay. NHL Hockey features 4 different speed settings, selectable at the beginning of the game.</plot>

				<plot>This game is for 1 up to 6 players. When the game begins, you can place the bets, for the winner or  for the first and second place. Then you can choose if an horse must be driven by a player or by the CPU. Only the third and the fourth horse can be driven by the players. There are 3 types of terrain: turf, mud or dry. [CR]When the race begins, the horses are speedier at the beginning, slower toward the end. They are different for speed at the starting gate, stamina, speed at the straight line, and for speed with different conditions of the race terrain. You (and the CPU too!) have the whip and the coax to spur a horse, and these tools could be useful to win a race even with a more tired horse.</plot>

There is a radar screen too, that shows all the damages made by the terrorists, the fires extinguished and the enemies shut down.[CR]The terrorists hits can damage the engine, the navigation system, the cannons and the radar. The player can return to home base (Force Island) for repairs and refuelling, but only two times per mission (the 3rd time after eliminating all the fiends).

				<plot>Ice Trek is one of a number of Imagic titles developed exclusively for the Intellivision; unlike Atlantis or Dragonfire, it was not later ported to the Atari 2600 or other systems. Taking the role of a warrior named Vali, the player must cross the Nordic countryside in order to destroy the Ice Palace of Kaltkron. The first level consists of a side scrolling forest, in which the player must cross-country ski to avoid both trees and waves of oncoming caribou.  Caribou that cannot be avoided may be shot with arrows, but this can invoke the wrath of a goddess who will appear on the corner of the screen and attempt to shot down the player in kind.  The second level charges the player with crossing a wide expansive of water, from the bottom to the top.  Using a grappling hook, the player must drag chunks of floating ice to add to the length of the ice bridge.  The player is also armed with a torch, to shoot fireballs at those pieces of ice that are aimed towards the completed pieces of bridge.  If those pieces do manage to hit the bridge, that part of the span will break off and float away.  Time is of the essence, as too much time spent on the ice will cause Vali to turn blue and eventually freeze to death.  In the final screen, the player must take out enemies who are perched along the top of the fortress using his fireball spitting torch.  The enemies in kind will fire back at the player with black crystals, and are protected by ice blocks that must be shot away first.  Once all enemies are defeated, the ice fortress will collapse on itself in an ending cinematic.  The game then begins again with the first level, but with an increase in difficulty level.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Anatomy of a Lady Bug Maze. Lady Bug is a Maze game in the style of Pac-Man in which players control the titular character, who must devour all of the dots on each stage in order to move forward to the next. In pursuit of Lady Bug are the nefarious Bugs, who give relentless chase and will kill Lady Bug if they catch up. However, Lady Bug has the ability to alter the maze with various turnstiles that can be pushed to block off old pass ageways and create new ones, offering escape routes from the oncoming Bugs.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The border of the screen will change color at a set rate, and when the entire border has shifted color, a signal will alert the player that a new Bug is about to be released from the center chamber. This process continues until four Bugs are in the maze, at which point the stage's Bonus Vegetable will be present in the center chamber. Eating the Bonus Chamber will score Lady Bug a large quantity of points, as well as having the side effect of freezing all enemy Bugs on screen for a brief period of time.The turnstiles are what make Lady Bug unique as a game. Each turnstile can be moved into a horizontal or vertical position, changing the layout of the maze. Bugs cannot change turnstiles, making it the player's only feasible advantage over the enemy. The game's maze is designed in such a way that it is impossible to completely block off any section of the maze, so the player must always remain agile and moving to avoid new threats. That said, arranging these turnstiles in particular patterns can confuse the Bug AI and make dot collection much easier.Advenced Strategy Perfect Play: trapped Bugs, confusing turnstile layout. Ultimately, getting high scores on Lady Bug starts with eating three blue hearts as quickly as possible in order to jack up the multiplier to five. Additionally, collecting at least one (if not more) Bonus Vegetables in each stage will pad score as well. Collecting letters at their correct colors is also key. The most difficult part of Lady Bug is avoiding the pursuers, however using turnstiles in select patterns can often confuse the computer's AI enough to protect the player for long stretches of time.Building a "home base" to hole up in works pretty well, especially if bugs need to turn multiple times to reach the player. Additionally, creating two-block reservoirs tends to trap Bugs indefinitely. Combining these two techniques can put the bugs in predictable locations, making an easy pathway to the bonus vegetable. The key to this strategy is to clear out the lower half of the screen first, since this is where Bugs tend to collect most often. Stay still in the base and wait for the bugs to settle into static positions, and then go for the kill.[CR]Bonus Items[CR] Red, Yellow, Blue.  Match colors for big bonuses.Scattered across each maze are six bonus items: Three Hearts, and three letters. These icons also shift color in cycles from a long blue period, to a fast red period, and a middle-grade yellow period. Collecting these items at specific colors is one of the keys to scoring big points in Lady Bug and can greatly increase survivability.Hearts and MultiplierHearts are linked to each stage's Score Multiplier, and should always be collected BLUE. The first blue heart collected will increase all points gained in that stage by double. the second blue heart will then triple all scoring, and the third blue heart multiples all scoring by five. Any hearts collected at other color will not affect the multiplier at all. Luckily, since the bonus items are blue the longest, these are relatively easy to collect.SpecialLady Bug SPECIAL Vegetable Harvest.Collecting the letters in the word "SPECIAL" during their short red phase is a primary goal of Lady Bug. Doing so will net a special bonus depending on the version of the game. In Arcade Lady Bug, collecting the SPECIAL bonus will give players credit for a free game. In the Colecovision version, collecting the SPECIAL bonus will send Lady Bug to a "Vegetable Harvest" stage with no enemies and many high value vegetables to eat. The Intellivision version has no SPECIAL bonus.After completing the SPECIAL bonus, players move onto the next stage.Extra Lady Bug EXTRA bonus.Collecting the letters in the word "EXTRA" during their middle-grade yellow phase with net the player a bonus life in all versions of the game. In addition, players are automatically skipped to the next stage. As the word EXTRA has only three unique letter instead of SPECIAL's five, it is much easier to complete this bonus.Collecting any letter outside of its affiliated color will net points, however will not go toward spelling its word. For instance, collecting a red letter "X" in ineffective towards the EXTRA bonus. However, the player scores more points for red letters versus yellow, and yellow versus blue, so collecting red letters that are extraneous can still help pad the score. Also, vowels like "E" and "A" can be collected either red or yellow depending on which bonus word the player intends to spell.[CR]Bonus Vegetables[CR]Each of the first 18 stages is assigned a Bonus Vegetable that increases in point value by 500 points. This vegetable appears in the center chamber after the fourth Bug has been released. By eating the Bonus Vegetable, the player gains a ton of points and the Bugs freeze in their tracks for a handful of seconds. While Lady Bug cannot kill the Bugs even while they are frozen, this can be used to great tactical advantage when attempting to collect dots in difficult places. In many situations, it is possible to collect more than one Bonus Vegetable in each stage (see below).It's also worth noting that some of the vegetables are particularly strange and somewhat out of place.[CR]Bugs[CR] Enemy Bugs: Colorful but Deadly.There are eight variations of Bugs that appear sequentially from stages one through eight. These bugs look different, however they all act the same with rudimentary AI. Bugs cannot be killed directly by the Lady Bug in any way. Even a Bug frozen by eating the Bonus Vegetable is still deadly to the touch. Bugs can however kill themselves by running into Skulls (see below).In the Colecovision version of Lady Bug, the Bugs double in traveling speed starting in stage 9. This makes the task of avoiding Bugs exponentially more difficult. They also begin to appear on a rotational basis, with Bugs 1 through 4 inhabiting stage 9, 2 through 5 in stage 10, and so on.[CR]Skulls[CR]More Skulls could equal more vegetables.Each stage contains a set number of Skull objects randomly placed in the maze. Skulls cannot be eaten by Lady Bug, and will cause instant death. Likewise, the enemy Bugs cannot eat skulls either, or they will perish and return to the center chamber. The upside to this is that any Bug that enters an empty center chamber will regenerate a new Bonus Vegetable when it is released. By doing so it is possible to collect many vegetables in one stage.Stage 1 starts with two skulls, and progressively more are added until stage 10, where there are five skulls indefinitely moving forward.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The objective of Lock 'n' Chase to traverse the maze and collect as many coins as possible. The main character is a thief who must steal as many treasures as possible from the vault (the maze) without being caught by the Super D (the policemen), named Stiffy, Scaredy, Smarty and Silly. The thief can open and close doorways to trap and slow down the Super D but only two doorways may be closed at a time. Each coin is worth 20 points while money bags, which appear randomly in the center of the maze, are worth anywhere from 500 to 4000 points. Each level also has a specific treasure that will appear at the center of the maze that worth 200 to 500 points each. The treasures are different for every level and include a top hat, crown, briefcase and telephone.Upon its release in the United States, two different versions of the arcade cabinet were released. The more common, Data East cabinet featured its DECO cassette system which allowed for the cassettes to be switched to different games at ease. On the other hand, the much rarer, Taito cabinet featured a dedicated motherboard and was produced in very limited quantities. Only about 1200 are said to have been produced and Lock 'n' Chase was the last Taito game to feature this old style cabinet. Mattel later ported the game to the Intellivision, Atari 2600 and Apple II, with the Atari 2600 version later being re-released by Telegames. A Game Boy port was also developed by Data East.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Based on a 1982 coin-op, Loco-Motion is a puzzle-style arcade game in which a train is riding on a grid of movable track pieces. The goal is to guide the train through the train stations located around the edge of the playfield. An empty section in the grid allows the player to shift adjacent track pieces into that section to alter the train's path, and a tracing light shows the path the train is taking as it moves. An accelerator button moves the train more quickly on its path, and a panic button will switch the piece of track the train is on with a random track piece on the grid.[CR]A bonus timer ticks down during gameplay, showing how many points will be received if the train arrives at a station in a timely fashion. If the timer reaches zero, "Crazy Trains" and "Loop Sweepers" will appear and race down the track in an attempt to crash into your train. Other obstacles include "Crazy Tracks" which can send your train in another direction, and exploding stations (occurring occasionally if the bonus timer reaches zero.)[CR]Loco-Motion has 4 play speeds, and offers play for 1 player or 2 players alternating turns.</plot>

				<title_clean>Masters of the Universe: The Power of He-Man</title_clean>
				<plot>In Masters of the Universe, you control He-Man as he battles Skeletor in two different types of arcade action scenes. In the first part of the game, you control the Wind Raider flying towards Castle Grayskull. You have a limited amount of fuel with which to reach your destination, plus numerous fireballs will be flying around the screen trying to stop you and Skeletor will be running along the ground. The Wind Raider is equipped with bombs and guns which can be used to defend yourself from the fireballs, and also can earn bonus points if you can hit Skeletor. The second part of the game takes place on foot. When you've landed near the castle, He-Man needs to pursue Skeletor. Skeletor will be firing numerous lightning bolts which can be blocked with a shield. There is a time limit here, and you must get past all of the screens and catch Skeletor before time runs out. If you are successful, the game will repeat at a tougher skill level.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Nihon Bussan's Mission-X had a similar vertical scrolling shooter gameplay to Namco's Xevious, released later in 1982.The arcade game was later ported to the Intellivision console by Mattel Electronics in 1983.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]You are a fighter plane bombing ships, bridges, and tanks, occasionally you use your guns on other planes that attack you. Shoot oncoming planes and ground targets using your gun. Bomb all enemy sea and land craft, gun emplacements, bridges and transportation networks. A low flying attack gives the best hit ratio but be careful, it is dangerous.Mission X lets you fly right and left while the action scrolls forward vertically. However, instead of letting you backup or go straight ahead on the screen, pressing up and down on the control disc causes your bomber to lose and gain altitude respectively. This way you can duck under or fly over enemy attacks. This is the key difference between Missile-X and the Xevious series.At the end of a level, you will need to try touch down your plane to the runway for bonus points. Land on the air strip for extra points between stages. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>You're a microsurgeon, and your patient is in critical condition! First you need to examine the patient's medical chart to find out what's wrong, and which conditions are the most critical. Now to save the patient, you control a robot probe which can be used to administer aspirin, antiseptic, or ultrasonics to clear up the problem. You should clear up the most critical conditions first, then move on to the less serious areas to ensure your patient survives. Your probe should navigate through the veins, arteries, and lymph; if you guide the probe outside these areas, it's movement will slow down and swarms of white blood cells will attack it, depleting the limited energy supply. There are 197 different patients you need to help, each with different ailments.</plot>

				<title_clean>Mountain Madness Super Pro Skiing</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mountain Madness Super Pro Skiing was developed by       Ray Kaestner for      Realtime Associates, and released in 1988 for the     Intellivision. While Mountain Madness is not officially a sequel, it serves as a spiritual successor to    U.S. Ski Team Skiing, and uses much of the same code.Much like in U.S. Ski Team Skiing, up to six players take turns skiing down a mountainside rife with trees and moguls attempting to earn the fastest time. Mountain Madness Super Pro Skiing adds more hazards, including ice and unpacked snow, and adds a selection of 32 preset mountainsides. The player also has the option of designing their own course, or skiing down a randomized slope.There is no computer AI in Mountain Madness, so the game can only be played in a solo practice mode or in competition with friends.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]SetupMountain Madness starts with selecting how many players will be playing, from one to six. The colors used for each skier are as follows:Player 1: Blue   The map preview screen Player 2: RedPlayer 3: TanPlayer 4: Dark GreenPlayer 5: GreenPlayer 6: YellowOnce the number of players is chosen, the "flag style" is selected, from either downhill, slalom, or no flags. Slalom is the most difficult, with narrow flag gates, while downhill has wider and more forgiving flag gates. No flags is exactly how it sounds: no flag gates, so the race is straight to the bottom of the course.Next, the course is selected. There are 32 preset courses in Mountain Madness, and a map showing their general path and conditions can be viewed before the selection is made. In addition, there is the option of a Helicopter course, which will take the player to a random course on a random mountain, or design their own course, which is discussed later.Finally, the slope for the course is chosen, which determines the speed of the skier. The slope varies between one (slow) and fifteen (very fast). In a reality-breaking move, players can choose different slopes for the same mountain course. However, time will move at the same pace, so players choosing a faster slope will have a definite advantage, provided they can control their skier without problems.RacingEach player takes their turn alone on the mountain, situated up at a starting gate with the best times from each player to the left. Before taking off, players can opt to view the map of the course one final time.  Racing through gates     Once they start, players guide their skier through flag gates (with the exception of no flags mode), while avoiding obstacles and hazards on the course. When a flag gate is successfully passed through, one of the flags will change color. There are two ways to maneuver the skier down the hill and through the gates. Normal turning is slow but more predictable, and scrubs off a little speed. The player can also use their edges to turn, which makes for sudden, faster turning that does not decrease the speed at much. However, using this method requires more planning of the course and is more difficult.The skier will encounter hazards such as trees, moguls, icy snow, and powder snow. Trees must be outright avoided, but moguls and powder can be jumped over safely. Icy snow does not need to be avoided, but will hamper the turning ability of the skier. Hitting any obstacles other than ice will cause the skier to crash, slowing them down tremendously and taking away all of their momentum. Hitting a flag is not as critical, but the impact will slow the skier down somewhat. Also, running into the crowd at the end of the track will trip up the skier. The end of a run     Once a skier passes through the finish gate, their time is tallied. Each gate missed will add two seconds to the final time at the end of the run. This also means that it is advisable to bypass any gates that will require more than two seconds to reach. The stats screen will show the previous best run, the time penalties accumulated, and the total time of the current run.Each skier receives three runs, with only their best run counting. The winner is the skier with the fastest time.Course DesignerBeyond the 32 courses in the game, players can create their own tracks using pre-fabricated segments of track. There are 28 of these segments to choose from when creating a course, and at least three segments (or at most fifteen segments) must be placed before the course can be used. Once the track is finished, players choose their slope, and the game continues normally with the custom course.Custom slopes cannot be saved, so players wishing to save their masterpiece would do well to write down all the segment numbers used for future reference.[CR]Game Room[CR]On March 24th, 2010, Mountain Madness was added to the  Game Room. Since the game only keeps track of course time and offers a wide variety of courses, there is no leaderboard support. The only challenge medals available when playing Mountain Madness are the Time Spender medals, which are (aptly enough) awarded for spending time playing the game.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Mouse Trap is an arcade action game similar to Pac-Man. You control a mouse in a maze; your goal is to eat all of the bits of cheese in order to score points and move on to the next maze. Wandering throughout the maze are several cats who are trying to catch you! Your mouse has the ability to temporarily turn into a dog and be able to chase the cats. To do so, however, he will need to eat the dog bones which are located throughout the maze. The maze also contains numerous doors. The mouse can move these doors to reconfigure the maze in an attempt to outsmart the cats.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Night Stalker traps players in the middle of a cavernous                maze, with no hopes of escape. The objective is to last as long as possible while blasting as many enemies as possible using guns strewn throughout the maze. A steady "heartbeat" sound serves as the game's unique soundtrack amidst the sound of bullets.Night Stalker was released for the               Intellivision in 1982. It was ported to the              Atari 2600 (under the name Dark Cavern),             Apple II,            PC, and           Aquarius shortly afterwards.[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]Night Stalker was the first and only game created by Steve Montero as a lead programmer, and began development in 1981. While its frantic gameplay became an instant hit amongst other programmers at the office, the game's difficulty changed somewhat when a 12-year-old was allowed to playtest the game and outperformed everyone at          Mattel Electronics. The spider's unique ability of laying down player-slowing web was scrapped to make room for a more difficult enemy: the         invisible        robot.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The maze The player starts with six lives, and always       respawns in the middle of the maze, in the      bunker. Provided the player is completely inside the bunker, robots will be unable to kill the player (until 50,000 points, when the bunker's safety is threatened). A yellow gun will appear and flash somewhere in the maze, and it is up to the player to run out of the bunker and pick up the gun while dodging enemies. Once a gun has been picked up, the player can begin to fire at enemies. Each gun contains six bullets, and only one bullet from the player may be on the screen at any time. When all the bullets have been used, a new gun appears somewhere in the maze, and the process begins anew.The player can only die if shot by a robot. If this happens, the lives remaining will appear briefly in the lower left corner, the player respawns in the bunker, and a new gun is placed in the maze.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]At any given time, a maximum of four enemies will patrol the     maze: a spider, two support enemies, and the main    robot. Only robots can kill the player.Spider The Spider     The spider spawns in the web in the upper left corner, and moves randomly about the maze at a slow pace. The spider has a venomous bite, and will knock down and paralyze the player for a few seconds upon contact. The spider is easily killed with a single bullet, but it will respawn in the web shortly after its death. The spider is unaffected by robot fire.Bat Bat     The maze contains two vampire bats at the start of the game, which will awaken from the upper right corner of the maze and fly around randomly. The bats are rather quick, and will bite and paralyze the player for a few seconds upon contact, much like the spider. Their speed makes this paralysis slightly more dangerous, as a bat can move back and forth over a player and keep them paralyzed for an extended period of time, unable to move and susceptible to robot attack.Bats can be killed by a single bullet or robot fire, and when the score is under 5000, new bats will respawn to replace their fallen comrades. Once the score surpasses 5000, any killed bats remain dead permanently, and grey robots spawn to replace them.Grey Robot Grey Robot     The first robot the player encounters in the maze, spawning in the narrow passage in the lower left corner. It moves about slowly and randomly, firing at the player whenever it thinks it has a shot, and is easily killed by one bullet. Once the score reaches 5000, the grey robot will replace any slain bats, but no longer serves as the main robot adversary.Blue Robot Blue Robot     The blue robot appears at 5,000 points, replacing the original grey robot. It moves more intelligently than its predecessor, and will move more directly and aggressively towards the player. It is also killed with a single bullet.White Robot White Robot     The white robot replaces the blue robot at 15,000 points, and will also attempt to aggressively track down the player. The white robot is also much sturdier, and requires three bullets to kill. The first and second bullet hits will cause its shield to flash yellow.Black Robot Black Robot     At 30,000 points, the white robot steps aside for the black robot. The black robot moves quickly after the player, and also takes three bullets to kill. This is made even more difficult by the black robot's special white bullets, which will absorb any player bullets that come in contact with it, making crossfire shots worthless.At 50,000 points, the black robot's bullets are upgraded, and turn into yellow energy shots capable of destroying not only bullets, but the center bunker as well. If the black robot is allowed to shoot the bunker, there will be no constantly safe area for the player to hide for the remainder of the game.Invisible RobotIn the event the player reaches 80,000 points, the toughest robot comes out to play -- the invisible robot. The only way to determine this robot's exact location is through the bullets it fires; otherwise, it is virtually impossible to track.   The invisible robot is actually just a black robot colored blue to match the maze's background. Its shape is visible when it is hit the first and second time, and through some of the energy blasts it fires. Its behavior appears to match the black robot's, as well, and its energy blasts will also absorb bullets and destroy the bunker (if any pieces are remaining at this point).[CR][B]Strategy:[/B][CR]It is first important to remember that the   Intellivision cannot process input from the disc and numpad on one controller at the same time, making running and shooting at the same time difficult. However, if one controller is used to move, and the other to shoot, running and gunning is much easier. This two-controller technique is extremely handy for precision control in Night Stalker, where dodging robot fire is a necessity.Once the score surpasses 5,000 points, it is advisable to avoid shooting bats, to prevent additional robots from entering the maze. While the bat deaths are inevitable, leaving them alive makes the main robot more vulnerable and easy to target.Another important but often overlooked nuance: While the player can only have one bullet on the screen at a time, the robots also can only have one bullet on the screen at once, even if three robots are in play. This can be used for evading robots, as if a stray bullet is traveling down a long side corridor, the robots cannot harm the player as he runs about the maze. This technique can also be used to exploit and effectively " spawn camp" the robot entrance at the bottom. The grey and blue robots can be repeatedly killed by well-timed bullet as they slowly enter the maze. Later robots can be tricked into firing their bullet by the player peeking out around a nearby corner, and once the bullet passes by, the player can drop down and fire off quick shots to destroy the robot with ease.This act of dodging robot fire and returning fire becomes especially handy as the game progresses, most notably with the black robot's bullet-absorbing blasts.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Points are scored, unsurprisingly, by shooting enemies.Spiders: 100 pointsBats: 300 pointsGrey Robot: 300 pointsBlue Robot: 500 pointsWhite Robot: 1,000 pointsBlack Robot: 2,000 pointsInvisible Robot: 4,000 points Extra lives are earned every 10,000 points.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Pinball is a pinball simulation for one or two players. You begin the game with five balls, and need to score as many points as possible by hitting the ball into the various bumpers and targets on the pinball table. The pinball table consists of three different screens, each with a different layout and level of difficulty. To advance from one screen to the next, you need to use a single ball to hit several targets and then get the ball into a white cup that appears. If you are on the second or third screen and the ball falls off the bottom, you will be back to the lower screen; if the ball falls off the bottom screen you will lose that ball. The game ends when all five balls have been lost.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A shortcut!Pitfall! is a 2D platforming adventure where the player has to find 32 treasures within a time limit of 20 minutes. Players control the character Pitfall Harry and have to guide him through a dense forest filled with deadly obstacles such as snakes, scorpions, rolling logs, alligator infested swamps, and bottomless pits.The game had many basic gameplay elements that are now common in all platformers. Harry had the ability to jump, swing, climb ladders and run left or right on the screen. The game places Harry on the left side of the screen by default, but a player could choose to tackle the jungle by going right on the screen. The game also had many secret passages which could be used as shortcuts.[CR]Release History[CR]Pitfall! was created in 1982 by Activision employee David Crane. The game was a technical achievement in that it had multiple animated sprites of varying colors with no flickering. Pitfall! introduced the basic concept of having a character jump around to avoid obstacles and collect items, which is now the basis for all platformers. The game was a massive success on the Atari 2600 and had ports for numerous game systems afterwards.The character in the game is lovingly referred to as Pitfall Harry.[CR][B]Fun Facts:[/B][CR]Pitfall! was used in an episode of South Park in which Father Maxy had to traverse a series of levels (with himself being the main character) to retrieve a lost scroll hidden in the catacombs of The Vatican.In 1982, then-unknown actor Jack Black was in a Pitfall! commercial.Actor Bruce Campbell of Evil Dead fame would eventually play the voice of Pitfall Harry in the Playstation version of the game.When Pitfall! was originally sold, anyone who scored above 20,000 points could send Activision a picture of his or her television screen to receive a Pitfall Harry's Explorers' Club patch.In Marvel Ultimate Alliance, the player must complete a game of Pitfall! using their own character in order to proceed in a mission.In Call Of Duty: Black Ops II: this game is playable through a secret in the Nuketown 2025 map.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Popeye must catch hearts, musical notes, or letter from the word "HELP" that his girlfriend Olive Oyl, who is located at the top of the screen, is tossing down. These items slowly floating items descend to the bottom of the screen and eventually 'break' unless Popeye can collect them.Popeye's nemesis, Bluto, pursues him throughout each of the repeating three stages. The Sea Hag also appears to hurl bottles, etc. at our hero. Sweet Pea and Wimpy also make appearances but only serve to provide opportunities to score more points.The three stages consist of the dock level, the street level, and the ship level. Difficulty increases each time the player completes the set of stages. Controls consist of an 8-way joystick and a 'punch' button.[CR]History &amp; Design[CR] Original Arcade CabinetPopeye was released by Nintendo in 1982. Its cabinet is the same design as the earlier more recognizable Donkey Kong and the later Donkey Kong Jr. cabinets. A cocktail table version was also released. The game was designed by Genyo Takeda and a young upstart designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. The Popeye characters were originally going to be used for Donkey Kong, but Nintendo decided to go with an original character creation that evolved into the iconic Mario. The CPU was a Z80 Chip running at 4MHz. Sound was produced using a AY8910 chip running at 2MHz. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Three Stages of PopeyeTHE DOCK STAGE - Popeye must catch 24 hearts that Olive Oyl tosses down one at a time. The HUD displays how many hearts the player has collected. If a heart reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will lose a life if he doesn't retrieve the breaking heart after about 10 seconds.Bluto chases Popeye throughout the stage. There are two ways he can be temporarily disposed of. One is by punching the signature can of spinach that will periodically appear on the sides of the screen. Once the can is punched, Popeye gets stong and turns red for about 10 seconds and has the ability to punch Bluto, sending him bouncing across the screen and into the sea. Catching hearts while in this 'red mode' will also net double points. The player will get 3000 points knocking out Bluto but he will shortly climb back out and continue his pursuit. The second way he can be incapacitated is by hitting a punching bag that dislodges a bucket. If timed right, the bucket will fall on Bluto's head giving the player 2000 points and some time to grabs some more hearts before he eventually pulls the bucket off.Both Bluto and the Sea Hag like to throw bottles at Popeye. These bottles can be broken by punching them. Bluto throws his bottles in groups of four and the Sea Hag will periodically show up on the side of the screen, throw one and disappear. Sometimes there will will be one on each side and they'll simultaneously throw a bottle, attempting to 'sandwich' Popeye between them is he isn't fast enough with his punches. Bluto can also jump up to a higher level or reach down to a lower level to knock Popeye out. Players should take caution when passing Bluto directly above or below him.THE STREET STAGE - This stage is similar to the first but features a different level layout and Olive throws musical notes instead of hearts. There is also a seesaw located in the lower left corner that, if timed right, allows Popeye to be launched in the air, thanks to Wimpy standing on the other end. Once in the air, Popeye can touch Sweet Pea for a point bonus who is floating above with a balloon.THE SHIP STAGE - The final stage features similar gameplay with two different features. One is there is a sliding platform at the top. Second each time Popeye catches one of the H-E-L-P letters that Olive tosses him, a ladder step will appear. Once enough letters are caught and the ladder is completed, Popeye can climb up and rescue Olive. The Sea Hag's pet vulture will also come out on the left side of the screen. Popeye can punch it continuously for points.Once Popeye rescues Olive, players are treated to a short intermission where Popeye's theme song is played while his face appears on the screen, blowing his signature "toot, toot" on his pipe. Players are then returned to the first stage again with increased difficulty. The Sea Hag now send bouncing skulls at Popeye, which are more difficult to punch. They will also fall down from an above level and knock him on the head if he is walking directly below.[CR]Ports[CR]Popeye was ported to several popular home consoles in subsequent years including the Atari 2600 and 5200, Intellivision, Colecovision, Odyssey2, and eventually came full circle releasing on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Ports to computer systems included the Texas Instruments TI-99, Atari XL, and Commodore 64. A mobile phone version was also released in 2008.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of Q*Bert is to navigate Q*Bert around an isometric pyramid structure. Each hop on a cube of the pyramid changes the color of its surface. The game will specify what color the entire pyramid must be changed to in order to advance. Multicolored discs alongside the pyramid allow for a quick getaway, but disappear once used.[CR]Arcade Cabinet[CR]The game designers wanted to add the sound of Q*Bert hitting the ground after falling off of the pyramid, so a pinball "knocker" (the solenoid that alerts the player that they've won a free game) was incorporated into the cabinet.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]The most common foe Q*Bert will encounter is Coily the snake, who hops down the pyramid structure. Once he reaches the bottom, he "uncoils" and chases after Q*Bert until he finishes the level or is killed. Red balls also bounce down the pyramid structure that Q*Bert must avoid. Slick and Sam are two more enemies that run around the structure changing the colors of the pyramid back to their original colors, slowing Q*Bert's progress. Unlike the other enemies in the game, Q*Bert can get rid of Slick and Sam by jumping on them.[CR]Other Versions[CR]Faster Harder More Challenging Q*Bert was to be the tougher successor to the original game. Changes, such as moving multicolored discs, lived up to the name, but the product was canceled before being released.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Reversi is a computerized version of the board game Othello. During the game, two players take turns placing game pieces on the board in an attempt to trap pieces of their opponents color. Any trapped pieces will then be reversed in color. When the board becomes completely filled up, whomever has the most pieces of his own color on the board wins. The game can be played by two players, or one player against the computer. There are three skill levels the computer can use, and three different board sizes are available, 6 by 6, 8 by 8, and 10 by 10.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Programmed entirely by  Carol Shaw (one of the first female game designers), River Raid puts the player in control of a fighter jet tasked with flying over a river from a  top-down, vertical perspective, shooting enemy vehicles like news helicopters, planes, and civilian cargo ships. Other than dodging enemy vehicles, your primary concern is your jet's fuel level, which slowly depletes over time, and can be replenished by flying over fuel pads found throughout the environment, however shooting a fuel tank will also boost your score by several points, making whether or not to fuel up or go for the points somewhat of a strategic decision. Inexplicably, the plane will also explode if it flies over land. While River Raid features the forced movement common in scrolling shooters, you can affect the speed of the scroll with your jet by pressing either up or down on the control stick.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]River Raid was the first video game in history to be listed by the German Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons, cited for "its intent to compromise the minds of children by forcing a paramilitaristic [sic] education upon them, and the playing of which caused cramps, anger, headaches and aggressiveness". The Department finally admitted that River Raid was harmless in 2002.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>If you don't always have someone to play cards with and you're not challenged enough by Solitaire, this cartridge introduces you to three players and three different card games: Hearts, Rummy and Crazy Eights. Your computer deals the cards and keeps score. You can choose to play against one, two or three players. [CR]One player game [CR]Choose from three different games [CR]One, two, or three computer opponents [CR][CR]PRODUCTION HISTORY:[CR]While a fairly minor release (36,000 initial shipment), Royal Dealer had a major effect on the development cycle inside Mattel Electronics. Long overdue from APh, when the game was finished it went straight into production with only brief playtesting by a few other programmers. When it was too late, it was discovered that the cartridge contained a major -- and easy to come across -- bug that crashed the game. Because of the low sales expected, Marketing decided to ship the cartridge anyway with an errata slip, but they were furious. The Quality Assurance department, which had frequently been bypassed on late games such as this one and B-17 Bomber, was immediately given life-or-death authority over all future games: nothing was allowed to be released until the official game testers Traci Roux and Dale Lynn had signed off on it. They were merciless: stomping on a game then gleefully showing the videotaped results to the programmer when they found a bug. But it paid off; to this day, we haven't seen any reports of bugs in games they approved.[CR][CR]Bugs:[CR]Recreating the bug discussed above was outlined in a September 30, 1982 memo from game tester Traci Roux to Joel Crain, head of Quality Assurance: [CR]The following steps lead to the problems with Royal Dealer. They occur in all four games. [CR]1.  You are rearranging your cards and have a card out of the deck. Then one of the players lays down her final card and that round ends. [CR]2.  The new round starts and you hit the disk. The card from the last hand appears. Depending on how you rearrange and throw your cards, different errors can occur. (If you hit rearrange first, the game will progress normally, and the errors never occur.) The errors that occur are: [CR]     a. You can rearrange the blank cards that are displayed. If you rearrange enough times,the program gets confused and the screen blanks out. You have to hit reset to start over. [CR]     b. Sometimes when you lift up a card to rearrange, you see it where the card was. This usually occurs if this is one card by itself. [CR]     c. If you have to draw 15 cards and they are all in a row, it usually will not let you pass. The result is that you have to hit reset to start over. [CR]     d. In Rummy, if you win the round the music plays and the card screen comes up. The screen doesn't show "GIN" by your hand and a card shows up in your final hand that wasn't there before. Results are that you can't continue to the next hand, and you have to hit reset to start over. [CR]     e. If a gap appears between your cards, you cannot get to the cards on the left side of the gap. The gap will go away if you can discard your cards on the right of the gap. If you need a heart, for example, and you draw until you have 15 cards, you may have to pass. If there is a heart on the left side of the gap, you cannot get to it, the program sees the heart, and will not allow you to pass. The result is you have to hit reset to start over.[CR]Because of this bug, the following errata slip was added to the packaging: "Please correct your instruction booklet on Page 2 to read: You can only rearrange your cards each time it is your turn before playing or discarding a card from your hand. Once you have played or discarded, you must wait until your next turn before rearranging your cards." [CR]http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/credits/gaming.html#royal[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Sea Battle</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In Sea Battle, two players form fleets of ships, and use strategy and battle tactics to attempt to capture their opponent's harbor. Naval combat is practically a certainty, and players will utilize guns, torpedoes, and mines to engage and sink any opposing ships that block their way to the enemy harbor.Sea Battle was developed by Ken Smith at APh Technological Consulting, and was released in 1980 for the Intellivision. It was part of the Action Network series of games, and like many APh-developed titles, Sea Battle was also one of the first games released for the Intellivision console. Sears also released Sea Battle under their Tele-Games Super Video Arcade brand. In 2000, an Atari 2600 port was released as a limited edition product for collectors. On March 24th, 2010, Sea Battle was part of the first wave of games to become available in the Xbox 360 Game Room.It is important to note that Sea Battle has no enemy AI, so without two human players, the game loses a significant amount of its entertainment value.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In every game of Sea Battle, players start with the same assortment of 13 ships, which can be deployed in various manners from their harbor. The ocean map is always the same, as is the harbor positions for both sides. Player one commands the grey navy, whose ships will always face east, and player two commands the tan navy, whose ships always face west.ObjectiveOpposing harbors and fleetsThe aim of Sea Battle is to pilot ships into your enemy's harbor, which will capture it and end the battle. Initially, the only two ships that are capable of capturing the harbors are the aircraft carrier and the troop transport. However, if both sides lose these ships, then any ship is eligible for capturing the harbor.An important key in this objective is that combat, while almost certain, is not a necessity to win the game. Crafty fleet maneuvers and a careless enemy could lead to an easy victory without any ships engaging in combat.ShipsEach player starts with 13 ships in their navy, and can create a maximum of four fleets, consisting of three ships each, at any given time. The various characteristics for each ship are as follows:Number Available: How many of that ship are in your navy. Once the ship sinks, it is gone for the rest of the match.Top Speed: The fastest the ship can move. Fleets move as fast as the slowest ship within them.Acceleration: How long it takes a ship to reach top speed or change direction. This is far more crucial when navigating in combat, since ships out of combat rarely have a reason to move nimbly.Armor: The number of hit points, or HP, of damage a ship can resist before sinking. For example, if a ship has 10 HP of armor, it will sink after taking 11 HP of damage -- 10 for the armor, and another 1 HP to sink it.Weapon Type: There are three kinds of weapons in Sea Battle: Guns, torpedoes, and mines. Guns must be aimed precisely and hit a target at their landing point in the targeting cross-hairs to do damage. Torpedoes do not require this accuracy, and will do damage if they connect with a target anywhere along the path to the targeting cross-hairs. Mines are only used outside of combat, and up to four minefields can be placed invisibly during the strategic phase.Weapon Strength: The amount of damage the weapon deals upon successfully hitting a target.Weapon Range: The distance a ship's targeting cross-hairs can travel to fire weaponry. Short-range weapons will naturally require a ship to get closer to their target before opening fire.Aircraft CarrierAircraft CarrierNumber Available: 1Top Speed: 30 KnotsAcceleration: SlowArmor: 25 HPWeapon Type: GunWeapon Strength: 10 HPWeapon Range: LongThe aircraft carrier is a slow-moving hulk of a ship, with excellent armor and decent weaponry to offset its slow movement. While tempting to take into combat, care should be taken to keep the aircraft carrier floating, as it is one of two ships that can capture the enemy's harbor at any time (the troop transport being the other ship).Troop TransportTroop TransportNumber Available: 1Top Speed: 30 KnotsAcceleration: SluggishArmor: 25 HPWeapon Type: GunWeapon Strength: 7 HPWeapon Range: Very ShortThe troop transport can withstand a good amount of damage, much like the aircraft carrier, but its weaponry is well below average for defending itself from enemy ships. While it is fully capable of capturing the enemy's harbor at any time, the troop transport will almost certainly need other ships to defend it from attack.BattleshipBattleshipNumber Available: 2Top Speed: 35 KnotsAcceleration: AverageArmor: 30 HPWeapon Type: GunWeapon Strength: 12 HPWeapon Range: LongThe battleship is the most heavily armored ship in the game, and its speed and weapons are both above average. It may not be the nimblest ship available, but it is a good all-around choice for attacking enemies and protecting high-value ships.SubmarineSubmarineNumber Available: 1Top Speed: 35 KnotsAcceleration: QuickArmor: 15 HPWeapon Type: TorpedoWeapon Strength: 20 HPWeapon Range: Very LongThe submarine is destined for destruction. It's very fast and extremely agile in the water, and its torpedoes are the most powerful weapons available in the combat phase. Its trade-off for incredible attacking power is below-average armor, which means caution must be used in frantic engagements. However, the only weapons that will outright sink a submarine in one hit are mines or another submarine's torpedoes, so it's by no means fragile.DestroyerDestroyerNumber Available: 3Top Speed: 40 KnotsAcceleration: QuickArmor: 15 HPWeapon Type: GunWeapon Strength: 9 HPWeapon Range: ModerateWhat the destroyer lacks in armor and weaponry, it makes up for in speed. It's not the ideal choice for most battles, but an expert navigator could overcome its inadequacies. Plus, as the most numerous ship available, it can fill out any fleet formation decently.PT BoatPT BoatNumber Available: 2Top Speed: 40 KnotsAcceleration: Very QuickArmor: 5 HPWeapon Type: TorpedoWeapon Strength: 12 HPWeapon Range: ShortThe PT boat's heart and soul lies in running and gunning. It is without doubt the fastest ship available, and its torpedoes make it a very dangerous threat. However, its armor is basically non-existent, so any other ship can sink the PT boat with one direct hit. Its best chance at survival is passing closeby a slow ship, firing torpedoes, and retreating as fast as possible for another run.Mine LayerMine LayerNumber Available: 1Top Speed: 20 KnotsAcceleration: AverageArmor: 15 HPWeapon Type: Gun/MinesWeapon Strength: 6 HP/20 HPWeapon Range: Very ShortThe mine layer is a terrible ship in a head-on fight, and doesn't hold much of a chance at surviving against most other ships. The mine layer's true advantage is in its ability to place up to four minefields in the ocean during the strategic phase. These minefields are completely invisible, and the only way the enemy will know the location of one for sure is if they sail a fleet over it, causing 20 HP of damage to the fleet's flagship immediately, and another 20 HP every few seconds if they're careless enough to stay within the minefield. While an extremely dangerous trait, each navy only has one mine layer, and losing the ability to place mines early on in a battle could be a crucial mistake.Mine SweeperMine SweeperNumber Available: 2Top Speed: 30 Knots, 15 Knots in Sweep ModeAcceleration: AverageArmor: 20 HPWeapon Type: GunWeapon Strength: 6 HPWeapon Range: Very LongThe mine sweeper is another ship that should probably avoid direct naval conflict, with incredibly weak weaponry and slightly-above average armor. Its talent is in countering the mine layer, and at any time it can go into Sweep Mode, which will remove any minefields the mine sweeper's fleet runs over. There is no indication as to whether a minefield has been successfully removed, though, and going into Sweep Mode drops the mine sweeper to an extremely slow speed, making it very susceptable to interception from enemy forces.Strategy PhaseSea Battle opens in the strategy phase with a map of the battlefield, which is an ocean littered with islands. A constant sonar beep will sound off to indicate the passage of time. Each side's ships begin docked at their harbor, and to begin, both sides must begin to form fleets.The ocean map at the beginning of the gameFleets consist of groups of one to three ships. Each navy can field a maximum of four fleets at any given time, and no fleet can have more than one of the same kind of ship. If the player tries to deploy a duplicate ship into a fleet, or selects a ship that is no longer at the harbor, the game will buzz, and the order will be ignored. The first ship selected for any fleet is considered the flagship, and the second and third ship ship will assume flagship command in that order in the event of sinking. While the fleet size is visible in the strategy phase, the types of ships currently in the fleet are not revealed.Players move one fleet at a time around the map, positioning them strategically or attempting to push towards the enemy harbor. The active fleet flashes slowly as it is maneuvered around the map. If a mine layer is deployed in a fleet, they can deploy up to four invisible minefields at any point in time.In the event a fleet needs to be repaired or reorganized, it can be piloted back to its home harbor and ordered to stop. Doing so will remove its ships from the ocean map, and fully repair any damage sustained. The ships can then be redeployed as normal. Regrouping at the home harbor can only be performed a total of three times during the battle.When two opposing fleets come within combat range of each other, they will begin to flash quickly, and the sonar sound will pause. At this point, either side has roughly five seconds to elect to engage the enemy, sending the battle into the combat phase. In the unlikely event neither side chooses to engage after five seconds, the strategy phase will continue, but if the fleets remain within combat range after a few seconds, they will be offered the opportunity to engage in combat again. When more than one fleet is within combat range, the game will cycle through all possible engagements, giving a player with multiple fleets in range the option of choosing which fleet (if any) they would prefer for combat.Combat PhaseOnce one side decides to engage an enemy fleet, the combat phase begins. Here, the screen zooms in on the region surrounding the two fleets, and reveals the exact ships in each fleet. Both players start off in control of their flagship, and can switch between ships as they control one ship at a time against the enemy fleet.Aiming in the combat phaseShips maneuver about based on their top speed and acceleration, and tend to exhibit inertia similar to heavy watercraft. To fire guns or torpedoes, the aim button must be held (which halts any thrust or steering), and a cross-hair will appear that can be moved about. The limits of the targeting cross-hair are based on a ship's weapon range, but once the cross-hair is brought out through aiming, it will stay consistent in its position relative to the ship if the ship continues to moves.Once the player fires, a barrage of gunfire or a torpedo, depending on the ship, will shoot out towards the crosshair, and the crosshair will reset (meaning every shot will need to be aimed prior to shooting). If the weapon connects with a ship, there will be an explosion; otherwise, a loud splash will be heard. A hit will deal the weapon's damage against the ship's HP. Hitting land during combat phase will deal 12 HP of damage every few seconds. This can be especially dangerous if a fleet enters combat mode close to land, as their ships may spawn right against land and take damage. When a ship loses its armor and takes any further damage, it sinks.A sinking ship amidst the battleThere are two ways to end the combat phase: completely destroying a fleet, or retreating. To retreat, one player must press the engage button to disengage. An alarm will sound, and fifteen seconds will elapse before the fleet retreats, so care must be taken to avoid any further damage from the enemy. Regardless of end condition, the game will return to the strategic phase afterwards. If the combat phase was ended through retreat, the retreating fleet should move quickly away from the enemy if possible. Otherwise, the opponent will be given the opportunity to re-engage after a few seconds.Basic StrategyTo achieve victory in Sea Battle, it is important to remember the initial condition for victory: sail an aircraft carrier or troop transport into the enemy's harbor. This means a wise player should work to defend both their harbor and their capturing ships above all else. Stationing a fleet as a last line of defense by the harbor is usually a good idea, and protecting routes to the harbor by planting minefields is also helpful, especially since minefields cannot damage the team that planted them.An early victory. Don't leave your harbor undefended!Pairing capturing ships with more offensive ships in a fleet will help ensure their security, should they come under attack. Both capturing ships should not be in the same fleet, as that puts them both at risk in a combat situation. Making a ship other than the aircraft carrier or troop transport the fleet flagships should be considered; that way, if the fleet runs through a minefield, the capturing ships are not severely crippled, since minefields will damage only the flagship first. Battleships, with 30 HP to withstand the 20 HP minefields, are probably a good flagship in these cases. Furthermore, using mine sweepers to escort capturing ships might help stave off an otherwise lethal attack. Losing both the aircraft carrier and troop transport early on means losing the ability to achieve victory until the enemy's capturing ships can be destroyed.Finally, while remembering one's own fleet configurations is handy in the strategic phase, it is even more useful to try and ascertain what the enemy is using in its fleets. Faster fleets might contain nothing but attack forces, while noticeably slow fleets could be either mine layers looking to lay dangerous minefields or mine sweepers looking to remove an opponent's mines.[CR]Atari 2600 Version[CR]At the July 2000 Classic Gaming Expo, a special version of Sea Battle was released for the Atari 2600 and made available to collectors. This port was likely done by Intellivision Productions, but it was published under the Retrotopia label, a term Intellivision Productions seems to use for its sponsorship of the expo.This special Atari 2600 version appears to have been a one-time production, and does not appear to be for sale anywhere. For this reason, it is likely quite rare.[CR]Xbox 360 Game Room[CR]The Game Room version of Sea Battle. Note the similar colors of the ships.Sea Battle was part of the first wave of titles featured in the Xbox 360 Game Room on March 24, 2010.The game is virtually the same visually, with the exception of Player 2's navy bearing a faint green tone, rather than orange. However, the need to bring up a "virtual numpad" to select fleet and commands not only make the game awkward, but ruins the secrecy of such commands, since players can easily view their opponent's input. This effectively renders the strategy component of Sea Battle completely useless.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Sharp Shot offers four mini-games, all of which are controlled using only a single button.  "UFO Attack" takes place in outer space. Your goal is to shoot down as many UFOs within the alloted time. Shooting down enemy ships is as easy as hitting the action button when they pass through your crosshair -- which is locked in the middle of the screen and cannot be moved. Two players can play this game.  "Submarine Patrol" has you launching torpedos from your submarine in order to sink enemy vessels. Your submarine will move back and forth on a horizontal path on the lower part of the screen; your torpedos will move upwards on a strictly vertical path, so hitting enemy vessels boils down to properly timing your shots. This is a single player game offering hot-seat multiplayer. "Critter hunt" is meant to be played competitively, offering two-player simultaneous play. Bugs and other critters will move through a mazelike grid on random patterns. Controlling bow and arrow, your goal is to hit as many creatures as possible within the time limit. Your arrows will move along the maze walls, travelling upwards all the while. Your bow will move from left to right (and back, respectively) on the lower edge of the screen; again it's a matter of timing boiling down to releasing your bow at the proper moment.  "Football" is a very simple representation of American Football. Playing as the quarterback it's your job to find an open receiver in the end zone and throwing him the ball -- which is as easy as moving your player up and down on the right side of the screen and releasing the ball the moment you're lined up with your two receivers in the endzone. Since there's no defensive line pressing down on your QB, it's only a matter of how many touchdowns you can score before the timer runs out.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Slap Shot Super Pro Hockey</title_clean>
				<plot>Super Pro Hockey is a one or two-player hockey game.  There are four handicap/skill levels to choose from after selecting whether or not the player wants a one or two-player game: Amateur, Rookie, Pro, Super Pro.  Essentially, changing the handicap results in changing speeds to the gameplay, from low (Amateur) to high (Super Pro).  There are no teams, only Home and Visitor.  [CR]Each team has three players and a goalie.  The home team is tan and the visitor team is green.  The player can only control one character at at time, and this character is colored lighter than the rest of the player's team.  Goalies are controlled by the computer.[CR]The game also features a special slap shot button, a penalty box, face-offs, interceptions, and tripping.  [CR]Tripping is considered a "legal" move if applied to the opponent character with the puck.  Penalties occur when a player trips an opponent character without a puck, and one player will be removed to the penalty box.  The team with the penalized player must now defend for a short time with one less man.  Supposedly, the computer "referee" will only call a penalty about one in three times tripping occurs.[CR]Various stats are maintained at the top of the screen, including score, penalty time, remaining time and which period the game is currently in.  Periods are shown as bars on the screen rather than numbers--one for first, two for second, three for third.[CR]The game has been criticized for essentially being little more than the original Intellivision NHL Hockey game with an added single player mode.</plot>

				<plot>Snafu is an arcade action game similar to the Atari game Surround. You control a constantly moving and growing wall; the goal is to trap all of your opponents before you become trapped yourself. If you crash into the borders of the screen, into another players wall, or your own wall, you are out for that round. The last player left standing wins the round! Several game options are available which allow or forbid diagonal movement, set obstacles in the playfield, allow a players wall to disappear or remain on the screen after they crash, control the speed of movement, and select the number of rounds to play. The game can be played by one or two human players, and optionally two additional computer players can be added for up to four players on the screen at a time.[CR]Also included is a two player only game where you control a serpent containing 10 links, and your goal is to bite the links off of your opponent one at a time. Only the very last link of the serpent can be bitten off, so you need to be sure you keep your tail away from your opponent! The screen walls and the players links are non lethal if you crash into them in this variation, however if you double back accross your own path you will lose a link. The first player to bite off all of his opponents links wins.</plot>

				<title_clean>Space Armada</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Armada is a    Space Invaders clone developed by   APh Technological Consulting and released in 1981 for the  Intellivision. Much like its influence, Space Armada features an upward-firing gun at the bottom of the screen, protective bunkers, and rows of enemies to shoot down. The reason such a blatant copy was created without legal complications is due to poor copyright protection for Space Invaders, which allowed any developer to make a game almost exactly like Space Invaders so long as it used a different name.Space Armada does have a few unique features compared to the original Space Invaders. Bunkers will not repair themselves between rounds, and enemies may turn invisible or drop explosive or homing projectiles in later rounds. The player can also elect to retry a failed round through a special practice mode.According to Intellivision Productions, Space Armada was the first Intellivision game to animate more than eight sprites through a technique called GRAM sequencing.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player has the choice of game or practice when starting a new game. If practice is chosen, the player will start at the last round of the previous game with full bunkers and lives, with enemies moving slightly slower than before. If a game has not yet been played, practice mode will start with round one.The game starts the player off with three protective bunkers and six lives. Each round begins with a wave of thirty-two target enemies, positioned in eight columns by four rows that slowly zig-zag towards the bottom of the screen. As enemies are shot, much like Space Invaders, the remaining ships will begin to speed up. Once all the ships in a round are destroyed, the game pauses briefly to display the score and lives remaining, and a new round begins.In addition to the basic targets, a red UFO will occasionally fly across the top of the screen. Shooting the UFO scores a random number of points, and also causes the most damaged bunker to completely regenerate.As rounds progress, enemies will increase speed and the rate they fire weapons. Explosive bombs with a blast radius may also be dropped, along with missiles that will home in on the player's gun. Enemies may also appear invisible at random in later rounds, sometimes reappearing as they close in on the bottom of the screen.When all lives have been expended or a target reaches the bottom of the screen, the game is over.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]There are two ways to score points in Space Armada.  Shooting a target scores ten times the round number in points; for example, 10 points per target in round one, 20 points in round two, and so on.  Shooting the UFO scores a random amount of points -- either one to thirty-two times the points for shooting a normal target.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]  Originally based on the popular  Battlestar Galactica  TV series, this space combat simulator was produced by    APh Technological Consulting for                    Mattel Electronics, programmed by                      Hal Finney and tested by    Dale Lynn.  Two versions of the game were released in a blue box and a red box. The  red box was the initial release and was eventually deemed too easy by   Lynn,  and eventually the general public. So a more difficult version, the  more commonly known blue box, was released as part of the "Intellivision  Space Action Network" series of games which included a super advanced speed mode that the original version did not.   The name was changed because,  although one of Mattel's subsidiaries, Concepts 2000, had the rights to produce the official line of  Battlestar Galactica toys , Mattel could not secure the license for their videogame. At the point that this was  discovered, development had been underway for a while. The name was  changed to the painfully generic "Space Battle", but the graphics remained the same. This is why the enemy ships  look like             Cylon raiders.     Red Box Version Blue Box version           [CR]Object [CR] Defend the Mothership from the invading squadrons of enemies using your  own squadrons. There are two screens a player will have to deal with  when playing. One is the radar view that shows the location of the  Mothership in the center, the player's squadrons of ships, and the enemy  squadrons. The other view is the cockpit view where the player will  move a            reticule around the screen to fire upon enemy ships.    Radar View     From the radar screen the player is able to direct his squadrons. The  player is given three squadrons with which to dispatch the enemies. A  blue, gold, and white squadron have the ability to be dispatched,  returned to base, or battle. When dispatching an alien must be selected  then the dispatch key for the appropriate color must be hit. This will  cause the squadron to proceed to the selected enemy. Once intercepted  your ship will start blinking. This means you can battle. This will  cause you to enter the cockpit mode.                In the battle view the player is presented with a view of the stars. The player is also given a          reticule with which to target enemy     Cockpit View     ships. Enemy ships will appear from off screen and  continue moving around on the screen. It is the player's job to move  the         reticule near the enemy ships so the explosion will hit  them and cause them to blow up. In the bottom left and right of the  screen are the number of ships left in the enemy's squadron and the  player's squadron respectively. One either of those numbers reach zero  the battle is over and the player will be returned to the radar view.          It is possible to blow up multiple enemy ships with one shot if time  right. When destroyed an enemy will let off three other explosions from  around the original explosion. If these explosions hit another enemy  ship it will be destroyed as well. This is why it becomes important to  lead some of your targets.  When in cockpit view the enemies will also fire at the player. The player must avoid these shots by keeping his        reticule away from the shot. These shots appear as two squares side by side separated by a little space that become red as they get closer (depth wise) to the player.  The player wins when all five enemy squadrons have been eliminated of the radar. A player loses when the Mothership has sustain too much damage. This happens when the siren has been going off for a set time. It is the management of the player's squadrons and his ability to switch quickly between the screens that will allow a player to master this game.  "Two player co-op" is also available but only in the cockpit view. In this case one player will control the      reticule while the other fires.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Space Hawk</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Hawk was developed and released for the Intellivision in 1981. The player's objective is to shoot down space hawks and other assorted anomalies without getting hit or caught in an explosion. The gameplay in Space Hawk bears several similarities to aspects of both Asteroids and Astrosmash, including zero-gravity inertia and a scoring system based on peak scores and multipliers. It also features the ability to switch the control method for both thrust and turning on the fly, which was somewhat unique for this era of gaming.[CR]Development[CR]The original code for Space Hawk was based off a game mode removed from Astrosmash that resembled Asteroids. This mode, originally programmed by John Sohl, was given to Bill Fisher, with instructions to alter it enough so that there would be no legal issues over the Asteroids-like gameplay. With the removal of asteroids and UFOs, and the addition of robot birds from space, gas bubbles, amoebas, and comets, the game now known as Space Hawk was cleared for release.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Fight, Mr. Spaceman!Space Hawk's gameplay is rather basic: shoot enemies, and don't collide with any enemies or objects. The player controls an spaceman, and can use thrust to fly about space while hunting for enemies to shoot. The spaceman can shoot blasts of gas in any direction, and as the shots get further away from him, they grow in size. In the event a situation is too tricky and a quick escape is needed, hyperspace can be used, which transports the spaceman to a different area of space at the cost of points.As the player's score increases, enemies become more aggressive, and new enemies begin to appear in space. Every time the spaceman collides with an enemy, or comes in contact with an explosion left by the enemy, he spins wildly, and a life and points are deducted. The player starts with five lives, and needless to say, once these are all gone, the game is over, and the peak score earned in the game is displayed.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]While the player will initially only encounter space hawks and gas bubbles at the start of the game, more enemies will appear as the score increases.Space HawkSpace HawkThese bird-like robots will fly around space, dropping gas bubbles for the player to avoid. They must be shot three times before they explode. It is crucial for the player to keep a space hawk on-screen when attempting to defeat it; if it moves too far off-screen, it could disappear for good, making all the player's effort worthless.Gas BubbleDropped by space hawks, gas bubbles take various shapes and colors, and will float around space. While they require only one shot to destroy, some bubbles may explode in a larger radius, making close-range fire an unwise move. As the difficulty increases, these bubbles will mysteriously float towards the player more frequently, as if compelled by some unseen force.CometsCometComets appear at 10,000 points and above. These shooting stars fly in a straight line, and are easily defeated with one shot. Other than their speed, they pose little threat to the spaceman.Small HawksSmaller versions of space hawks will eventually appear, emitting gas bubbles all the same. These miniature copies still require three shots to defeat, and their small size makes them a tougher target. While the game manual does not describe a specific point at which small hawks begin to appear, they seem to start showing up at some level above 20,000 points, and will increase in frequency until they are the sole type of hawk that appears.AmoebasSmall amoebas will occasionally appear when gas bubbles are burst at 40,000 points, with larger versions appearing at 200,000 points. These grey blobs are completely indestructible, so it's wise to fly away quickly or use hyperspace to avoid their gelatinous wrath. As the score continues to increase, the odds of encountering an amoeba after bursting a gas bubble will increase as well.Rainbow BubblesRainbow bubbles can be emitted by space hawks above 100,000 points, and as their name might suggest, they change color frequently. The only way to destroy a rainbow bubble is by shooting it when it turns green -- attempting to shoot it any other time will cause shots to deflect.Black HolesBlack holes, while described in the game manual as an invisible hazard that will cause the spaceman to spontaneously hyperspace to save his life, don't really exist. This is simply a glitch caused by the Intellivision controller in which a certain combination of disc and button inputs will cause the system to think the button used for hyperspace has been pressed. No joke.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Points are earned for destroying enemies and lost for dying or using hyperspace. The points increase/decrease is also affected by the multiplier in play, which goes up and multiplies the points as the score increases. The multiplier level also affects how often extra lives are earned.Bubbles: 20 pointsExplosive Bubbles: 40 pointsRainbow Bubbles: 50 pointsComets: 100 pointsSpace Hawks: 200 pointsSmall Hawks: 800 pointsLosing a Life: -100 pointsUsing Hyperspace: -200 pointsMultipliers1x: 0 - 999 points2x: 1,000 - 4,999 points3x: 5,000 - 19,999 points4x: 20,000 - 49,999 points5x: 50,000 - 199,999 points6x: 200,000 points or moreMuch like Astrosmash, it is possible to drop back down a multiplier level due to loss of points.Extra Lives1x through 3x: Earned every 1,000 points4x: Earned every 2,000 points5x and Beyond: Earned every 5,000 points[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In Space Spartans, players have to hunt down and destroy alien ships by travelling across a grid based map. Each grid is color coded depending on how many ships are in the sector. Alien shots will damage the player's ship and make it harder to control, aim or move around the map. The game's story claims it is a retelling of the famous battle of Thermopylae where a small number of Spartans held off the mighty army of Xerxes, but in space.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each game starts with the player placing 3 starbases. After that the player is free to use Hyperspace to travel around the map. Each square on the grid that has aliens is color coded. Green squares have up ro 4 aliens, yellow has up to 8, orange is up to 16, red is up to 32 and purple has 33 or more aliens. Once the player is in a grid that has aliens in it, the player can switch to a first person view and shoot at ships. Each ship gets destroyed in one shot; each shot from an alien ship will take down 1/3 of a random system in the player's ship. The systems are: Battle Computer : Automatically fires when an alien ship is in the player's crosshairsImpulse Drive - Governs how quickly the player can change direction in battleShields - Protects the ship from alien shotsTracking Computer - Locks on to alien ships in the player's crosshairsHyperdrive - Used to fly around the map screenStarbases placed at the start of the game serve 2 functions: to repair damaged systems and to restore the player's energy if it has depleted. [CR]Intellivoice[CR]This game supports the Intellivision's Intellivoice add-on. During play, there are 2 voices. The voice of the central computer (a male voice) tells players when the ship's energy is running low and how many aliens are in each sector. The ship computer (a female voice) informs players which systems are damaged after each alien shot lands.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball was an attempt to more realistically recreate the game of volleyball for the  Intellivision. To do this, more attention was payed to the speed and movements of the game and some basic rules were followed such as the first team to fifteen points wins a game as long as they have a two point advantage and best three out of five wins the match. The player may choose one of two main modes available. These modes are a two-on-two outdoor game and a six-on-six  game in a gymnasium. There is also a special two-player mode to allow player-on-player matches or two players to go up against the computer. The player controls one character at a time but can switch between any available characters at any time.[CR]</plot>

Drawbridge! Combo Course! And the MONSTER RALLY -- all events combined into one ironman challenge! [CR]* Compete alone, against a friend, or against the toughest computer driver ever! [CR][CR]DEVELOPMENT HISTORY:[CR]Essentially, this is a super-enhanced version by Rick Koenig of his own Motocross game for Mattel Electronics. Developed as Monster Truck Rally (and announced with that name in the Fall 1988 INTV catalog), the decision to change it to Stadium Mud Buggies was made after the game was complete. [CR]Christmas 1988 was bad for INTV Corp. The video game resurgence was in full swing, led by Nintendo. Mail orders were down, and the stores that had still been carrying Intellivision cartridges cut way back or stopped stocking them altogether, freeing up more shelf space for Nintendo games. As cash flow slowed, cartridge production of the completed Monster Truck Rally and Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball was put on hold and over a year went by without a new INTV game or catalog released. [CR]In 1989 INTV moved into Nintendo cartridge production, with the first release to be a conversion of Monster Truck Rally, also produced by Realtime Associates and again programmed by Rick. Apparently by using the completed Nintendo version of Monster Truck Rally as proof of INTV Corporation's promising new direction, INTV President Terry Valeski was able to raise enough cash or credit to put the two finished Intellivision games into production, and to mail out a Christmas 1989 catalog (which would turn out to be the last). [CR]Thinking that it might hurt the Nintendo Monster Truck Rally's chances if it was seen as based on an Intellivision game, Valeski had the name of the Intellivision version changed to Stadium Mud Buggies. The title screen name was changed, but the graphics remained the same -- the vehicles still look like trucks, not buggies. [CR]Ultimately, instead of releasing it themselves, the failing INTV Corporation sold the Nintendo Monster Truck Rally to another distributor to raise cash.[CR][CR]http://www.intellivisionlives.com/gamepage.php?gameId=93[CR]</plot>

				<plot>It's a stampede!! Your job is to round up as many of the calves as you can. The screen scrolls to the right as you chase the calves; if more than three calves get past you, the game is over. The calves all run at different speeds, and when you rope one you earn points based on how fast it was running. As the game progresses, more and more calves will be on the screen at one time, and other obstacles will begin appearing to trip your horse and slow you down.</plot>

				<plot>Star Strike was clearly inspired by the Death Star battle sequence in the movie Star Wars. You fly a space craft into the enemy launch trench. Your mission: to destroy the alien station before Earth passes directly over the launch trench. You must evade the alien ships that are defending the launch trench while being sure to bomb the red "Hot Targets". The very first red target that is missed when the Earth is directly in the middle of the launch trench becomes a missile. The missile is launched and destroys Earth.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Strategic insight from the boxPlayers take control of a snowspeeder on the planet Hoth, and are pitted against an endless stream of AT-AT walkers marching left to right. If a walker reaches the far right side of the game world, the game ends. The AT-ATs have ports that open periodically; fire a shot into that port, and the walker explodes in one shot. Otherwise, 64 shots are needed to bring one down.By default, the player has 5 lives and can only take 3 shots before exploding (unless hit by a smart bomb). As the difficulty increases, the AT-ATs become faster, and the game ends when all 5 speeders are destroyed or when they reach Echo Base and destroy it.Settings can be adjusted to change the movement speed of the walkers, or allow the walkers to fire smart bombs. Another option makes the walkers solid, which causes the ship to crash if it collides with the AT-AT sprite, rather than flying through.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Sub Hunt</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sub Hunt was developed by    Tom Loughry at   APh Technological Consulting and released for the  Intellivision in 1981. In the game, players take command of a fleet of four submarines and engage waves of enemy ships before they can rendezvous at a staging point to attack the player's home base. Success in Sub Hunt typically requires strategy in both the positioning of the player's fleet of subs and the effective battle tactics, utilizing stealth where necessary to avoid losing a submarine to attack.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player begins Sub Hunt by selecting one of five levels of difficulty, which determines the enemy country's color, along with the power and aggressiveness of their ships.The game opens on an ocean map screen, with the player's four subs just west of home base, the enemy's staging point to the north, and an advancing enemy wave of ships in the far west. From here, any of the player's submarines can be ordered to move about the map, and will continue to move until ordered to stop or combat ensues. When a sub and an enemy wave collide, combat ensues.When combat begins, the perspective switches to the submarine engaging the enemy, and gives the player full control of its engines, rudder, depth, and sonar. From here, the player must choose how to take on the wave, which consists of six ships, at least one of which is a high-powered destroyer. If any of the enemy ships spot the player sub, either through visual or by picking up its sonar, they will begin to fire guns or depth charges at it, depending on whether the submarine is on the surface or underwater. The submarines have two torpedo tubes and unlimited torpedoes to fight back, but must get within a close range to take out enemy ships. When the entire enemy wave or the sub sinks, or the enemy wave moves out of range, the game switches back to the ocean map screen.Three destroyers are stationed at the enemy's staging point, so if three additional ships join them, they will form a final strike fleet, and head towards the player's home base. This fleet is tougher than the initial enemy waves, and letting it reach the home base shores will result in game over.The enemy will send six waves towards the staging point, for a total of 36 ships. To win the game, all these ships must be destroyed while protecting home base from capture.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Super Cobra is a side scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</plot>

Scott Robitelle was a friend of Dave Warhol's who had done the hardware design of the development systems used by Realtime Associates. Dave gave him a shot at designing a game. (A later game programmed by Scott, Choplifter!, was never finished.)[CR]Super Pro Decathlon was timed for release with the 1988 Summer Olympics.[CR][CR]FUN FACT:[CR]For the title screen music, Dave Warhol recycled the fanfare he wrote for the unreleased Mattel Electronics cartridge Go For The Gold.[CR]INTV used the successful "Super Pro" designation, despite the fact there are no professional decathlon competitions.[CR]http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/credits/intv3.html#decathlon[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Super Pro Football is a one or two-player football game.  There are only two teams, the Home Team and the Visiting Team (orange and blue respectively).  Quarterbacks are colored differently than the rest of the team--red and dark blue for the Home and Visiting teams.[CR]After pressing Enter from the title screen, the player has the options of selecting if the players will be human or computer, and then their difficulty level, or rating--Rookie or Super Pro.  [CR]Prior to playing the game, the player (or computer) can select from a wide list of options and planning strategies for playing the game.  [CR]Options for the Defensive team include Formation, Tactic, Timeout, Stats, Controls, and Break.  "Break" exits the menu and begins gameplay.  "Stats" contains all the current information on the game including the timer, score, down, quarter, and time outs.  There are nine Formations to choose from, and four options under Tactics.  Formations can also be changed on the gameplay screen prior to the opponent team hiking the ball.  Controls are pretty basic, only really involving the control wheel.[CR]The options for the Offensive team include Formation, Kick, Recover 1, Recover 2, Timeout, Stats, Controls, and Break.  A "program receiver" appears under the Recover options.  Like defense, there are nine formation options.  Controls are more involved in offensive play, including hiking, kicking, passing high or low, and running.[CR]The game is seen from a top-down view and scrolls left-to-right to move with the gameplay.</plot>

				<plot>A one or two player "Dungeons &amp; Dragons"-style dungeon crawl.  In a one-player game, the player controls the Warrior Prince on his quest to collect treasures, learn the secrets of the Fortress of the Sinister Serpent, and locate the Serpent's lair. In a two-player game, the right player controls the Warrior Prince, while the left player controls Nilrem the Wizard.[CR]As you explore the labyrinthine fortress you can collect treasures, magic scrolls, and healing items while battling Phantom Knights and Red Sorcerers.  But be careful -- if your adversaries catch you, you can lose half a life, and may need to be "reincarnated."  Each player has only 9 Reincarnations, and when those are gone, it's "Game Over."</plot>

As the players control Duncan on the ice he'll leave a white line behind him (carving in the ice), the goal of the game is to make a square with the white line while the other penguins are inside. When a circle is complete the animals who were inside will turn into ice-cubes. But watch out because there are others out to get you, a red seal who will send the players flying if it gets to close and who also will repair the damage you are doing to the ice (the white lines), the seal will also return onto the screen after a short while if it was trapped in a square and a Polar Bear. Players will have the option to swim across the water where the ice has been carved out, this will however result the disappearance of the white line. Once all the other penguins have been turned into ice-cubes a new level will start with a Zamboni driving across the ice and fixing it.[CR]</plot>

The quest takes the knight into three different realms of danger, each with its own challenges, and an ever changing maze of which they must navigate through.  The quest is broken down into these challenges:[CR]Forest - The Knight must confront three dragons, each one more difficult than the last.  Along the way, an enchanted bat will give him the strength to overcome the danger.[CR]Castle - The Knight must overcome six wizards, his only aid being a mouse that will generally try to avoid capture.[CR]Dungeon - A randomly appearing skull is the only defense against the nine demons that make up the sinister dungeons.[CR]Along the way, the items that the Knight will find may be of some help (or hinder) his quest to make it through the different areas.  Challenge the areas again and again for the highest score possible!</plot>

				<plot>Reaching high towards the heavens, the Tower of Doom stands, beckoning brave adventures to confront the bizarre creatures and brave the deadly traps it contains in hopes of collecting the bountiful treasures and magical items found within its corridors.[CR]Tower of Doom is a single-player, Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired adventure title created exclusively for the Intellivision. Choose from 10 different character classes, each with its own strengths. 7 different quests are available for play, with the harder quests featuring randomized maps and magic item effects. After choosing the quest to embark on, players will then control their character using a top-down view of the section of the dungeon they are in, the corridors and rooms being drawn on-screen as they explore them. Also to the player's disposal is a display of the character's inventory which can be utilized at any time, and an on-screen map of the entire dungeon. Encountering a creature will initiate a battle screen at which time players can fight the creature or attempt to bribe it with items they have discovered. Magic items and traps can also be found in the dungeon, each having unique effects on the player.</plot>

The MCP has plans for world domination, and only Flynn can stop it.[CR]The ultimate goal of Maze-A-Tron is to disable the MCP. Maze-A-Tron is played in rounds; Circuit Maze and the Master Control Program. You go around the maze and collect energy for your shields, which can be used to protect Flynn from some enemies. You also collect zeroes that are used to clear RAM. [CR]When you proceed to the Master Control Program, the MCP works to fix the RAM you cleared. Your goal here is to fire a Bit-Gun at pairs of BIT streams and BIT stacks before they hit the top of the screen.[CR]These two phases repeat with a higher difficulty each time.</plot>

				<plot>Take the role of Flynn in Tron: Solar Sailer, an Intellivoice game based on the movie Tron. Navigate your way through the computer world to find the MCP (Master Computer Program). Overload the MCP to escape the computer world and return to reality![CR]Tron: Solar Sailer is a 1-player game with 2 stages of gameplay. In stage one, the player is given an access code to write down, and then is to guide the solar sailer down tracks in the computer world with the goal of reaching Track 0, where the MCP is located. As the player traverses the tracks, tanks attempt to shoot the sailer and recognizers attempted to move the sailer farther away from Track 0. I/O beams teleport the player closer to the MCP if they can properly enter the access code given to them at the beginning of the game. Moving down a track and shooting at enemies depletes energy from the track; switching tracks restores energy to full. If energy fully depletes before the player switches tracks, the sailer stops moving and the game is over. Energy levels can be monitored by the amount of "energy bugs" on the grid surrounding the track, with more bugs meaning more track energy. An audible warning also announces when track energy is low.[CR]If the player makes it to Track 0, stage two begins. The player is placed in the heart of the MCP as it attempts to make continuous data transmissions to keep the player from entering the override code, thereby overloading the MCP and allowing Flynn to escape the computer program. 0s and 1s fly at the player in a first-person view. An in-game voice gives the player the override code in binary, and the player uses a cursor to catch the appropriate bits. Using the number pad, the player can then specify where in the code sequence the captured bit should go. Red bits, when colliding with the cursor, automatically fill in a randomly selected part of the sequence. This area is timed, so the code must be entered as quickly as possible![CR]Once the correct sequence has been entered, the MCP overloads and the game is over. However, the game gives the option of going into "Overtime Mode" for extra points, at which point the player attempts to block all incoming transmissions or lose the game.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Designed by   Rick Levine and published by  Imagic in 1983, Truckin' is a truck driving simulator that puts players behind a 18-wheeler semi truck. A network of 68 cities and 59 interstate routes are available to travel solo or with another person. An accelerated day-night cycle is also featured, with a full 24 hours taking two minutes in real time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]When starting the game, two game modes are available: Interstate Race, and Hauling Cargo. Players can either play solo and try to earn the best time/score, or compete head-to-head with a friend in split-screen with the orange truck versus the grey truck. In solo mode, the screen remains split, the unused truck remains at the starting point, and the side of the screen not in use displays information such as time and date. The second player can join in at any time after the game's start if desired.Interstate RaceIn Interstate Race, eight cities are selected as checkpoints: San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, Portland, Chicago, Detroit, and Boston. To finish the race, all eight cities must be visited in any order. The trucks start by default in San Diego, but this may be changed before either truck exits the game menu.Players start off with a balance of $1500 in Interstate Race, no fuel, and no cargo. Refueling can be done in any major city, and costs $120 for a full tank. Truckers will also get tired after extended driving or crashing, causing their possible top speed to decrease. Refreshing a trucker involves stopping on the side of the road and resting for a period of time. If this is done anywhere outside of a forest or park, it costs $30.No cargo hauling is done in Interstate Race, so the only other problems truckers face are other truckers, state police, and ghost truckers. Computer controlled truckers are psychotic fiends with no regard for human safety, and will weave all over the road and across lanes regardless of the direction they are traveling. Colliding with these horrible monstrosities will cost $50 and a few seconds for repairs. State police will sometimes tail the player truckers if they exceed the local speed limit, and if the player does not hammer the brake and slow down below the limit within a few seconds, the cop could stop the player for a few seconds and issue a fine as high as $200. Finally, the player, in experiencing the natural delusions of life on the road, may witness computer controlled truckers that suddenly disappear. While the game manual for Truckin' passes these off as hallucinations, it may be a known bug that was rationalized rather than fixed.In the depressing event sixty days pass before the race is completed, the race simply ends.Cargo HaulingIn Cargo Hauling, players are given $500 to start, and within a set time limit must pick up, transport, and deliver as many loads of cargo as possible to earn the most money. The time limit is five days by default, but can be altered anywhere between one to sixty days if desired (two minutes to two hours in real time).The cargo available for transport includes milk, cattle, corn, and gravel. Multiple loads of some commodities can be carried at once, such as gravel, corn, gravel and corn, or gravel and milk. The reward for a successful delivery ranges from $280 for a single load of gravel to $1000 for a load of cattle. Truckers can also call ahead to upcoming cities to see what transport jobs they have available, which may be handy for filling out the cargo and planning future routes.In either mode, the game does not end if the player runs out of money -- monetary penalties are not incurred when broke. If the player runs out of fuel outside a city, they will receive a complimentary quarter-tank at midnight to get them moving again. This costs $30, or nothing if the player is completely broke.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released by Sega in 1981, Turbo is a single-player racing game that uses a pseudo-3D, third-person, rear-view racer format, much like Namco's famous Pole Position in 1982. The arcade version of Turbo was released in Japan and North America in 1981, and in Europe in 1982.Unlike modern racing games, which feature starting and ending points, Turbo contains four screens which loop infinitely until the player runs out of time. In effect, this means that the player has to focus on keeping away from the other cars, as hitting them will cause a crash, rather than trying to win the race.[CR]ColecoVision Port[CR]While Pole Position had been licensed by Atari, Turbo was licensed by their rival Coleco. To simulate the arcade experience of the original, the ColecoVision version featured a racing wheel peripheral, which contained a steering wheel, attached gas pedal, and gear shifter that had a high and low setting.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The other games that ran on the same Sega VCO Object hardware are SubRoc-3D and Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom, both released in 1982. Turbo was a spiritual predecessor to Sega's popular Hang-On and OutRun franchises. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tutankham is an arcade game developed by Konami in 1982; in this game, players control an explorer who is grave robbing Tutankhamun's tomb. Players will search for valuable treasure (a map, an urn, a chest of gold &amp; jewels and most importantly the golden death mask of King Tut) and fight off the various creatures that guard the tomb to ultimately find the way through the catacombs.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players must guide the explorer through a series of progressively more difficult mazes across four different stages. The explorer may move in four directions, but can only fire in two directions, left and right, making the player helpless in vertical shafts. There are also "warp zones" located in random parts of each maze that allow the explorer to be teleported from one area of the maze to another. There are several different creatures that constantly materialize from &#8220;spawning areas&#8221; within the maze and attack including asps, vultures, parrots, bats, dragons and curses. Those creatures can be destroyed to score between 20, and 60 points with either bullets or a "flash bomb&#8221;. The explorer has a single &#8220;flash bomb&#8221; per life and stage that destroys all enemies on the screen.On each stage, the explorer must pick up keys in order to unlock the door to the room where each of the treasures are kept, allowing progress to the next stage. Along the way the explorer may grab optional treasures (Rings, Crowns, etc.) for bonus points. If the timer reaches zero, the player's ability to fire is removed. Bonus points are awarded based on the amount of extra time left over when a level is completed. After players have recovered all four of King Tut's treasures, the game starts over again with increased difficulty.[CR]Ports[CR]Tutankham was ported to the  Atari 2600,  Atari 8-bit computers,  ColecoVision,  IntelliVision,  Odyssey 2,  Vic-20,  TI-99/4A and most recently the original arcade game is one of the launch games for  Game Room on Xbox Live Arcade.[CR]Additional Information[CR]The game was originally titled Tutankhamen, but the publisher discovered the full name could not fit on the final production arcade cabinet, so the title was shortenedThis game is also known as Horror Maze on  Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits for the  Nintendo DS.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Venture is a dungeon-crawling action game originally developed by Howell Ivy at Exidy. It was released into arcades in 1981. Home versions began appearing in 1982, with Coleco picking up the rights to publish ports on the Colecovision, Intellivision, and Atari 2600. Atari Corporation would eventually re-release the 2600 port in 1988.[CR]Objective[CR]Players control Winky, a circular smiley face with a bow and arrow for a weapon. Winky can move and shoot in eight different directions. While he moves in straight lines quickly, Winky's gameplay control when shifting directions is slow and awkward. Most of the game's difficulty comes from Winky's lack of directional agility.Upon beginning a stage, players will be located in the outside "hallway". When Winky is in the stage's hallway, he is represented as a small dot and cannot shoot. The objective in the halls is to avoid green Hall Monsters while entering white doors to individual rooms.In each stage, there are four individual rooms with one or two entrance points each. In each room there is a treasure that Winky needs to grab, but also enemy creatures that will impede his path. After grabbing the treasure, Winky needs to exit the room alive. After succeeding in this task, the completed room will "white out" and become inaccessible. By completing all four individual rooms in each stage, that stage is considered complete, bonus score is tallied, and the next stage begins with new rooms and new treasure.The bonus score is determined by a timer. The faster that players finish a stage, the more bonus points they earn. There's no penalty for being slow, however players may not receive any bonus points. These bonus points are instrumental in racking up extra lives.[CR]The Treasure Chart[CR]Incomplete Chart.Each time players start a game, start a new stage, or die, they will be shown the blue treasure chart, which contains 36 question marks. Each time players find a treasure, it will replace the question mark on the chart. The act of finding a treasure requires players to enter each room, grab the treasure, and make it out of the room alive (killing all enemy creatures is, however, not required). There are nine total stages with four treasures each. While Venture is played for score, the ultimate goal is to complete the treasure chart.[CR]Hall Monsters[CR]The Hall Monster is invincible and must be avoided. The Hall Monsters are green evil entities that inhabit the halls of each stage. Each one is invincible and will pursue Winky tirelessly. In addition to guarding the halls, they will also enter individual rooms if players stick around for too long. They can not be defeated by any means, so the the only way to avoid Hall Monsters from inside rooms is to exit the room immediately. Their main purpose to to supply Winky with a sense of urgency, as each room must be completed rapidly to avoid death by Hall Monster.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Each room is named after its creature inhabitant. These creatures almost always act identically. Some creatures won't appear until Winky enters a specific portion of the room or until he grabs the treasure. One arrow shot will kill any creature, and that creature's corpse will remain on the screen for a short period of time. In a unique twist, the corpse of any creature is just as deadly as a live creature, so touching dead enemies is not allowed. Even more so, shooting a dead corpse will reset its decomposition timer, keeping it on screen for a longer period of time. In this way, shooting wildly can be terribly counter-productive, especially if enemy corpses are blocking the player's path to the treasure or the only exit!Stages[CR]Stage 1: PinkGoblin RoomStage 1 LayoutMost outside doors are easy to get to, so navigating the inner hallways is not necessary nor recommended. Only the top right Serpent Room requires using the inside door, and it's generally simple to get to without much threat from Hall Monsters.Goblin RoomSkeleton RoomContains two doors and three goblins. The lower door is the preferred entrance, with a more direct path to the treasure and more time to line up arrow shots.Skeleton RoomSerpent RoomContains two doors and three skeletons. The left door is the safer entrance, but it's a longer path to the treasure and it can sometimes be difficult to sneak in that door from the outside. With the treasure tucked away down a far path, players must be fast.Serpent RoomWall RoomContains two doors and three serpents. Entering from the left is practically required, as the three serpents crowd around the right door and there's little to no time to react. Players should shoot enemies fast, as their corpses will likely block access to the treasure for a short duration due to the cramped quarters.Wall RoomContains two doors and four moving walls. Either entrance is a safe bet. Wait for the top or bottom wall to open all the way up, then sneak into the center. The middle area is safe, so wait patiently for the upper or lower walls to completely retract again, then run back out.Stage 2: BlueSpider RoomStage 2 LayoutUse the wide open spots on either side of the map to avoid the Hall Monsters. These spots can also be used to lure Hall Monsters away from the middle room's door, which can be difficult to get into. Most other doors are fairly unobstructed and easy to get to.Spider RoomTroll RoomContains two doors and three initial spiders, followed by two additional spiders. Once players grab the treasure, any remaining spiders and spider corpses will immediately disappear, and two new, yellow spiders will appear, one in front of each door.Troll RoomTwo-Head RoomContains one door and three trolls. The room is initially blocked off so players cannot get into the inner chambers. After a few moments, wall sections will disappear allowing players to get inside.Two-Head RoomDragon RoomContains two doors and four two-headed creatures. The enemies do not appear until the payer grabs the treasure, and two will appear down each of the exit paths.Dragon RoomContains one door and four dragons. Players will be bombarded from the moment they enter the room, so the best tactic is to shoot to the sides and try to move left or right into the open spaces in order to buy time. If the dragons are driven away from the treasure, go grab it and shoot the dragons on the way out. If players miss their first few shots when when entering the room, players can go back out the door and come back in to reset the room and try again.Stage 3: YellowCyclops RoomStage 3 LayoutStick to outside doors, as they are easiest to get into and also tend to give the best tactical advantages once players get inside individual rooms. Getting into the center room can be tricky if the Hall Monsters gather there. Try to lure them out one side, then go around the other side to the door.Cyclops RoomGenie RoomContains one door and three cyclops. The cyclops have the unique ability of warping around the room, to they can be tough to kill and tougher to anticipate. It's completely possible for a cyclops to warp on top of Winky, registering instant death.Genie RoomDemon RoomContains two doors and three genies. Players must lure the genies away from the treasure in the left corner.Demon RoomContains two doors and three demons. The demons won't appear until players enter the narrow area of the key-shaped room. Grabbing the treasure and moving back out of the narrow area fast can keep this from happening, and usually shooting only one or two demons is necessary.Bat RoomBat RoomContains one door and three bats. There's not a lot of room move around and the bats close in fast, so accuracy matters most here. If players miss the first few shots, the room can be re-entered to reset the enemy locations.Stages 4 - 9A collection of treasures. After completing the three initial stages, stage four will return players to the "pink" hall with faster Hall Monsters and slightly faster creatures in each room. The same goes for stages 5 (blue) and stage six (yellow). Stage seven again returns players to the pink hall with very fast Hall Monsters that tend to be more aggressive and take a more direct path towards Winky. After completing stages 8 (blue) and 9 (yellow), players will have completed the treasure chart. Stage 9 will continue to repeat endlessly until all lives run out.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In White Water! your goal is to raft down a river in the shortest time possible. The river features many dangerous turns, rocks, whirlpools, barrels, and other obstacles that get in your way. You begin your trip with three men, and if you don't navigate carefully they can fall out of the raft! If any men remain in the raft, they can try pick up anyone who has fallen out but must do so before they hit a rock, a whirlpool, or leave the screen (if all of your men fall out of the raft, the game will end). In the easier game variations, your score is based on how quickly you can reach the finish line. In the more difficult game variations, you not only need to reach the finish line as quickly as possible but also need to earn points by landing your raft at various beaches along the way and collecting treasures that can be found in the forest. Some of the treasures will be guarded by the natives, so be careful (also be sure not to wander too far into the forest, or you'll become lost). The game ends when you reach the finish line, or all your men are lost either by falling in the river or in the forest.</plot>

				<plot>Felton Pinkerton wanted to take his wife to the fair, so he didn't get a chance to spray pesticide on his crop of corn. But due to his laziness, all of the bugs have now arrived and are trying to eat every last bit of corn! You control Felton who is armed with a spray gun. Your crop of corn is displayed on the left side of the screen, and you need to protect it from the incoming hoard of inchworms, moths, caterpillars, slugs, and other assorted bugs which approach rapidly from the right. If any of the bugs sneak past you, they will eat part of your corn crop. The game ends when all of the corn has been eaten. On each level you need to spray all of the bugs that appear in order to move on to the next round; as the rounds progress, the bugs become faster, more numerous, and home in quicker on the corn.</plot>

				<plot>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.[CR]Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</plot>

				<plot>You're piloting a biplane through enemy territory. Drop bombs on factories and ammunition depots. Engage enemy planes in dogfights to the death![CR]DEVELOPMENT HISTORY:[CR]Due to the popularity (especially with APh and Mattel programmers) of the Biplanes game in the Triple Action cartridge, APh proposed this one-player version. A prototype was shown to Mattel with scrolling mountain terrain and targets that could be bombed. The plane graphics, sound effects and flight control were lifted directly from Biplanes. (Enemy planes, which would have presented an artificial intelligence-programming challenge, were not included in the prototype but promised for the finished game.)[CR]Marketing (not as crazy about Biplanes as the programmers) chose not to release the game and it went unfinished.[CR][CR]FUN FACT: [CR]A nice touch is that the second you lose control and smash into the side of a mountain, another biplane flies on-screen, cheerfully circling the crash site, trailing a banner displaying your score.[CR]http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/credits/1983.html#air[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Use your paddle to bounce a ball against descending rows of colored bricks. Hit bricks disappear, scoring points.[CR]PRODUCTION HISTORY:[CR]Brickout! was an Intellivision version of the Atari arcade and video game Breakout. It was intended for the Triple Action cartridge, which was originally to have included five arcade-type games. Brickout! was shelved for fear of legal action from Atari; such fears also killed the original version of Astrosmash, which was an Asteroids-like game.[CR]The stand-alone version of the game was popular with the Mattel Electronics programmers. It finally had its commercial release on the Intellivision Lives! CD-ROM in December 1998.[CR]http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/credits/action.html#brickout[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Deep Pockets: Super Pro Pool and Billiards</title_clean>
				<plot>Deep Pockets is a unique pool and billiards game - it is actually NINE games in one. You can learn many pocket billiard (pool) and carom billiard games in the privacy and comfort of your own home - and brush up on rules and strategy before venturing out to a billiard parlor.[CR]Play against a friend, or practice "against yourself" -- in 1 player games, you control both players 1 and 2.[CR][CR]DEVELOPMENT HISTORY:[CR]Programming pool was a challenge: with 16 balls on the table, the game requires more than the Intellivision's 8 moving objects. At Mattel Electronics, Marketing had rarely allowed programmers to multiplex objects because they objected to the resulting screen flicker (the one exception had been the fireballs in Masters of the Universe: The Power of He-Man, since it made sense for them to flicker). But for pool, it was the only practical solution.[CR]Producer Dave Warhol tapped math-whiz Rick Koenig (Motocross) to work out the multiplexing and movement of the balls. Steve Ettinger (Hover Force) did the overall game design and program, becoming an expert in all the variations of pool and billiards in the process.[CR]By the time the game was completed, however, INTV Corporation had fallen into financial difficulties and was unable to pay for it. Realtime Associates retained ownership of the game and it was never released. The last game for the Intellivision system completed, it carries a 1990 copyright date, making Intellivision the only cartridge-based game system to have software produced for it in three separate decades (the earliest games carry a 1978 copyright date).[CR][CR]FUN FACT:[CR]The process of programming music for the Intellivision was a tedious, time-consuming job that Dave Warhol and Steve Ettinger, both musicians, had plenty of experience with. But for Deep Pockets, they tried an experiment: they programmed an interface that would convert a MIDI file into Intellivision sound chip code.[CR]They then hired a professional Blues pianist to improvise a theme on the piano. They recorded him, then processed the tape through a MIDI synthesizer, through their interface, and wound up with Intellivision code that accurately duplicated the music. The result: the first "live" Intellivision music playing on the title screen. Unfortunately, neither Dave nor Steve can remember the name of the pianist.[CR][CR]EASTER EGG:[CR]To display the credits, press 0 (zero) on either hand controller while the title screen is displayed.[CR]http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/credits/intv4.html#pool[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Four Intellivision sports hits in a single cartridge makes the "Official videogame of the 1984 Winter Olympics" a winner -- play Skiing, Hockey, Basketball and Boxing.[CR]DEVELOPMENT HISTORY:[CR]After Chris Markle, who was working on the official Winter Olympics cartridge, left Mattel Electronics, no one was assigned to continue it. Midway through 1983, Marketing suddenly realized they had spent millions of dollars to obtain the Winter Olympics license, but didn't have a Winter Olympics cartridge.[CR]Salvation came in the form of the multi-game album concept that Design &amp; Development had demonstrated with Happy Holidays. Keith Robinson (TRON Solar Sailer) was assigned the task of slapping together some old sports titles and calling it an Olympics cartridge.[CR]Of the previously released Intellivision Sports Network cartridges, six -- Boxing, NBA Basketball, NASL Soccer, Tennis, U.S. Ski Skiing, NHL Hockey -- were, in their amateur form, Olympic sports, so those were chosen to be in the album. Keith modified their code to remove designations such as HOME and VISITOR from the scores to make them look more like Olympic events.[CR]Monique Lujan-Bakerink animated a runner lighting the Olympic torch for the title screen, and David Warhol composed a fanfare that sounded very close to the familiar Olympic theme.[CR]The game went together very quickly and Marketing was delighted, even though it meant that six sets of hand controllers and an especially thick instruction book would have to go into the package. The boxes were already printed and ROMs were just about to be manufactured when the legal department threw a wrench into the works: Mattel had purchased a license for the 1984 Winter Olympics. They didn't have the rights to the Summer Olympics. Including summer sports on the Go For The Gold cartridge could open Mattel to a lawsuit. Legal demanded the summer sports be removed from the cartridge.[CR]Keith pointed out that would leave only Skiing and Hockey. Two games made for a pretty poor album. Marketing agreed that the cartridge couldn't be released that way. Keith, his boss Mike Minkoff (Snafu), and Marketing worked out a compromise that Legal thought they might be able to get away with: in addition to Skiing and Hockey, Boxing and Basketball would also be included. That would make half the cartridge winter sports (as opposed to before when it was mostly summer sports) and, since Boxing and Basketball are played indoors, they could be played in winter. (Yes, that was stretching it.)[CR]Keith reworked the cartridge to remove Soccer and Tennis, and new packaging was designed (only a black and white mockup was finished), but Mattel Electronics closed before the game went into manufacturing.[CR]FUN FACT:[CR]As a bonus, each cartridge was to come with an embroidered 1984 Winter Olympics patch. Mattel Electronics purchased tens of thousands of these, with little "GO FOR THE GOLD WITH MATTEL ELECTRONICS" ribbons attached. Mattel employees kept maybe a hundred or so as souvenirs; the rest are probably in a landfill somewhere.[CR]David Warhol recycled the Go For The Gold fanfare in the INTV Corp. release Super Pro Decathlon.[CR]http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/credits/1984.html#gold[CR]</plot>

				<plot>An arcade game. Carom your shots against the moving wall to fill in the pattern on the back grid.[CR]DEVELOPMENT HISTORY:[CR]This original game by Andy Sells looked great; it had a strong 3-D effect as the moving wall swept back and forth across the screen. But while Andy wanted to continue developing the game, management wanted to take advantage of his musical talents. (Shortly before coming to Mattel, his award-winning song "You Love Love [More Than You Love Me]" was recorded by the English group Buck's Fizz. Ask for it by name.)[CR]Andy was continually assigned to work on music and sound effects for other games, including Shark! Shark! and TRON Solar Sailer. He also co-developed the Intellivision sound development tool, Mr. Sound. Whenever he had a chance he returned to Grid Shock, but the game was never elevated to official status.[CR]While the game never made it onto the Intellivision release schedule, it was demonstrated as part of the Intellivision III product line. This was bogus; when the Intellivision III wasn't ready to be shown at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show, regular Intellivision screens with particularly nice graphics were passed off as examples of the forthcoming system. Grid Shock was one of these; color packaging was even printed up for it.[CR]After C.E.S., Andy never had a chance to return to the game. His boss, Manager Russ Haft, left Mattel for Atari; Andy was tapped to take his place. A short time later, Andy, too, left for Atari and Grid Shock was abandoned[CR]http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/credits/1983.html#gridshock[CR]</plot>

				<plot>A puzzle game -- move rows and columns of squares to line up matching colors.[CR]While experimenting with Intellivision graphics, someone in the Design &amp; Development department came up with a kaleidoscopic effect using sequenced GRAM.

Marketing had a suggestion: something sort of kind of like a Rubik's Cube. That's what Steve sort of kind of gave them. But while Steve continued to tinker with it when not working on higher priority games (including B-17 Bomber, Aquarius Utopia and Space Shuttle), Hypnotic Lights was never elevated to "official" status.</plot>

				<title_clean>Land Battle</title_clean>
				<plot>Land Battle is a two player war game which utilizes both strategic and tactical modes of play. Each player controls an array of forces with the objective of capturing or destroying his opponent's "flag."[CR]The game can be played on any of thousands of different countryside maps -- the first thousand of which are selectable at the beginning of the game. All of these maps show roads, towns, hills, lakes, forests, orchards, and fields, and these geographic features impose restrictions and necessitate clever planning on the part of the player.[CR]At the beginning of the game each player has control of the following military resources:[CR]* 12 infantry [CR]* 3 armored personnel carriers [CR]* 2 tanks [CR]* 1 artillery piece [CR]* 2 bazookas [CR]* 2 mortars [CR]* 1 flag [CR]You can capture opposing forces which subsequently become yours.[CR]In order to wage an effective war, you must allocate your resources into patrols, direct the patrols across the map, encounter enemy patrols, fight battles, besiege towns, and eventually capture or destroy the enemy flag.[CR]PRODUCTION HISTORY:[CR]This wargame simulation took a long time in programming (officially 391 days, compared to 170 days for Night Stalker, begun at about the same time); when completed in mid-1982, Marketing was concerned that its design already looked dated.[CR]A second concern was that, due to the complexity of the game, it required more memory than an Intellivision contained; the cartridge would have to include 256 bytes of RAM onboard. Only USCF Chess had been approved for onboard RAM, an expensive proposition.[CR]When the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) was given the green light, Gabriel Baum, VP of Applications Software, proposed changing Land Battle to an ECS title; the ECS had an additional 2K of RAM available for cartridges. Marketing resisted this -- they still wanted Land Battle as a stand-alone game. Peggi Decarli was assigned to give the game a graphics makeover.[CR]After the makeover, Marketing still didn't find it visually interesting enough. By that time, wargame fanatic Steve Sents, having completed Deadly Discs, had started work on an ECS wargame called Desert Fox, which Marketing liked the looks of better. The decision was made to kill Land Battle and incorporate as much of its gameplay and programming as possible into the Desert Fox design.[CR]http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/credits/action.html#land[CR]</plot>
