			<emu_comment>MESS/MAME Atari 2600 List by Zach Morris.  This list is filtered to remove duplicates, betas, etc.[CR][CR]The Atari 2600, or Atari VCS before 1982, is a home video game console released on September 11, 1977 by Atari, Inc. It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F game console.[CR]The console was originally sold as the Atari VCS, which stood for Video Computer System. Following the release of the Atari 5200 in 1982, the VCS was renamed to the "Atari 2600", after the unit's Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge, initially Combat, and later Pac-Man.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]3-D Tic-Tac-Toe is an Atari 2600 version of the popular game that attempted to cash in on the small 3D Tic-Tac-Toe craze of the 1970s. The game was released in 1980 and programmed by Carol Shaw, and was the first released video game designed by a woman. The game was published twice by Atari (one text label and one picture label) and once by Sears (as a text label).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Unlike traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe is played on four stacked 4x4 grids. Players alternate turns placing an 'X' or 'O' and must align 4 of their own symbols in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally to win, similar to Milton Bradley's board game Qubic. The game features simple graphics with white grids on a bright blue background.The game can be played either against a human opponent or AI which features 8 different skill levels; however, the AI can take a very long time to make a move on high difficulty levels, in late-game states.

				<title_clean>Open, Sesame!</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Open, Sesame! or Sesam, &#214;ffne Dich is a European exclusive Atari 2600 game developed and published by Bit Corporation in 1983.  It is a very simple platformer that is only truly notable for being the second and final Atari 2600 game to feature voice synthesis; the first being Quadrun.  The game features Ali Baba climbing to the top of the screen to get the "treasure" which is pictured as a giant crown, which upon reaching he says "Open, Sesame!" and the game begins anew.  While the game is rather obscure, it saw a few re-releases and had various versions so it is not very rare or expensive.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Open, Sesame! is single screen platformer featuring 5 horizontal levels the player, Ali Baba, walks across as well as a top platform featuring the goal, a crown.  Ali Baba travels on each platform to 2 blinking dots and activates them to extend a ladder to the next platform.  Every ladder in the level must be activated for Ali Baba to be able to reach the crown at the top.  A bonus dot occasionally spawns and starts to travel down the platforms, which gives the player extra points if it is touched.  The metal bar appearance of the platforms, game layout, and use of ladders is uncoincidentally reminiscent of Donkey Kong.  The four middle platforms in the game are patrolled by one enemy each, which simply walk slowly towards Ali Baba when he reaches that level.  If the player is in the middle of a ladder, they are unable to be touched by the enemies and the enemies ignore the player.  If an enemy touches Ali Baba, he falls off the platform to the bottom, loses a life, and starts over but the activated ladders do not reset.  A bonus meter slowly ticks down at the top of the screen indicating how many points the player will get for completing that level, and when it reaches zero the player is killed as if an enemy touched him.  Each stage gets progressively harder as the enemies move faster.Voice SynthesisWhat makes the rather average Open, Sesame! stand out is that it featured a voice synthesized "Open, Sesame!" at the beginning of each stage and when the game boots up.  This synthesis came after the popular Quadrun's synthesis but is technically more impressive, packing nearly a second of sound into 848 bytes.  Even with better compression and a longer soundclip, perhaps most impressive was the fact that a colorful crown is displayed on the screen while the voice clip plays.  Quadrun's voice synthesis took up all the 2600's available memory, so the screen had to be blanked out.  Unfortunately, the voice clip is barely recognizable as "Open, Sesame!" and sounds very muffled.  Without knowing the name or premise of the game, it would be very difficult to distinguish what is being said.  Quadrun's voice was somewhat distinct.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Drop that acid! Acid Drop is a puzzle game that plays exactly like    Sega's     Columns, with the only difference being that stacking blocks diagonally won't work. Before the game begins, you are given the option to choose from difficulty level 1-30, with each level increasing in speed. The main objective is to stack three of the same coloured blocks either vertically or horizontally, if the blocks reach the top of the screen, then it's   game over. [CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR] Acid Drop was the very last game released for the  Atari 2600 and is extremely rare to find. During gameplay, Beethoven's     Fur Elise plays in the background.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>The Activision Decathlon</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR]The classic game of button smashing and joystick torturing puts you through the series (ten by the number) of track and field events, ranging from long jump over hurdles to javelin throwing, which comprise the Decathlon.[CR]The events are:100-Meter DashLong JumpShot PutHigh Jump400-Meter Race110-Meter HurdlesDiscus ThrowPole VaultJavelin Throw1500-Meter Race[CR]Points are awarded for each event with running events garnering the player more points for lower times, jumping events garnering more points for further or higher jumps (this includes the pole vault) and throwing events garnering more points for longer distances thrown. The points are tallied and shown at the end of each event with the final total being given at the end of the game.Game Play[CR]The Activision Decathlon is a one-player only side-to-side game.[CR]This game uses a power meter for each event with power generated by quick side-to-side motion of the players joystick. The faster the side-to-side motion, the higher the power meter goes. Players must generate the highest amount of power possible for each event with some, such as running events, requiring power being generated as quickly as possible and then maintained until the finish of the race. Other events, such as jumping and throwing, require that the player generate the highest amount of power possible and then maintain that power while simultaneously pressing the joystick's button to achieve the furthest jumps and throws and the highest jumps and vaults. Maintaining the highest possible level of power while timing and pressing the button at the best possible moment can be quite challenging.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Adventure</title_clean>
				<plot>Adventure is an action role playing game for the Atari 2600. It contains one of the earliest examples of an "easter egg".Gameplay[CR]The hero must find a chalice and return it to the castle, while avoiding dragons. Gameplay begins in the hero's own yellow castle. Various difficulty settings control the number of dragons, castles, and objects exist in the game world.The game features three difficulty settings:1. A simplified version of the game which includes only the yellow dragon, and a single maze-like castle2. Includes the Bat and the Red Dragon and utilizes all components listed above.3. The hardest of difficulty settings, all items and enemies for the most part randomly placed at the beginning of the game.[CR]Creatures[CR]DragonsThese are the main enemies in the game. They pursue the hero throughout the mazes.Their behavior is slightly modified by one of the difficulty switches: In position B they ignore the fact that your character has a spear, and will sometimes impale themselves on it. In position A, they will flee from the spear.The other difficulty switch dictates the speed of their bite. In the B position, their mouth hesitates a bit before chomping down, allowing for a chance to escape. In the A position, they are much harder to avoid because there usually is very little pause between roar and bite.BatThe bat grabs items and dead dragons, and transports them to other parts of the maze. It, like other items in the game, can be grabbed by the hero.[CR]Items[CR]The Enchanted GobletThe goal of the game is to the chalice from its place inside the Black Castle and transport it to the Golden Castle. When it is inside, the game is won.KeysScattered throughout the kingdom are three keys, each of which grants access to the castle corresponding to their color.SpearThe Hero can use the spear to kill any of the dragons. In difficulty 'A' some dragons flee from the player if the spear is carried.MagnetThe magnet attracts all objects toward it (though only one at a time if there are multiple objects in the room). This can be very useful if an item is stuck in/on a wall, or is far away on the other side of a given screen.BridgeThe bridge allows passage between gaps in the various castles. It will span any vertical gap in the game.Easter Egg[CR]Adventure is notable for containing the first known example of an "easter egg" in a console game.[CR]Inside the black castle, in the south wall of a sealed chamber (accessible only with the bridge), is an "invisible" 1object referred to as the Gray Dot. The player must "bounce" the avatar along the bottom wall to "grab" the dot. The dot is not actually invisible, but is simply the same color as the wall and is easily seen when placed in a catacombs passage or over a normal wall. The dot is not attracted to the magnet, unlike most other objects in Adventure.[CR]Bringing this dot to the east end of the corridor below the Yellow Castle while other differently colored objects are present causes the wall object to similarly become effectively invisible, allowing the player to pass into a room displaying the words "Created by Warren Robinett".[CR]Robinett kept the Gray Dot a secret for over a year. He was unsure of whether or not it would be discovered by other Atari personnel prior to publishing; the dot was not mentioned in the game's manual, as the manual's author was unaware of the dot's existence. After the game was released, a fifteen-year-old from Salt Lake City discovered the Dot, and sent a letter to Atari explaining how to retrieve it. Robinett had already quit the company by this point, so Atari tasked designers with finding the responsible code. The one who found it said that if he were to fix it, he would change the message in the game to say "Fixed by Brad Stewart". Atari eventually decided to leave the Dot in-game, and dubbed such hidden features Easter eggs, saying they would be adding more such secrets to later games.[CR]Post Release[CR]Microsoft Game RoomAdventure was included in Microsoft's Game Room.This game is available to play for free at Atari's Arcade Website.  [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] View Credits[CR]On game two or three, go to the maze in the Black Castle. One screen left of the first maze screen will flicker if you carry an object in there meaning one thing, there's ANOTHER object in there. At the bottom center of this room is a closed off cubicle, use the bridge to get in there and you should pick up a ''dot''. Carry this to the screen just above the catacombs (one screen down and to the right of the Gold Castle) and be careful not to lose it as it's the same color as the outside ground. Drop it there and bring two other items onto the screen, run right through the line on the right side of the screen and witness the first ever Easter Egg.

Press Down to make your character move over the screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Slow Down the Music[CR]When you finish Adventure, press Select.</plot>

				<plot>The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen.[CR]There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends.[CR]The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much damage that they collapse.[CR]There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of these.</plot>

				<title_clean>Air-Sea Battle</title_clean>
				<plot>Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game.  On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen.  The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.[CR]In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft.  You are stationary.   Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile.  [CR]In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above.  On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen.  Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above.  Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired.[CR]In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again.  This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits).  The controls are as in games 1-6.  [CR]In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above.  Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed.  When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired.  [CR]In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below.  The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18.  The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below.  [CR]In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.[CR]Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds.  (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets.  I have yet to see this happen.)  In each of the single player games, the single player tries to outscore a computer opponent that simply constantly fires.</plot>

				<plot>The player is trapped in a crashed nuclear submarine which has begun taking on water. They need to escape by making their way up the levels of the submarine one at a time. Each floor has two hatch keys that need to be collected in order to unlock the elevator to the next level. There is a time limit, though; if you take too long the floor will flood and you'll be unable to escape. Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes. The player will need to jump over any torpedoes that cross their path, or they will be stunned momentarily and lose precious time.</plot>

				<plot>In this game based, loosely, on the movie of the same name, you have to move through a maze (the halls of your ship in the manual), ala Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs). [CR]If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot (pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.[CR]After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.</plot>

				<title_clean>The Alligator People</title_clean>
				<plot>This game is based on a 1959 20th Century Fox horror/sci-fi movie of the same name. You are Jane Marvin. Your finance and five of your friends are turning into alligators due to a failed medical experiment. You must get the alligator antidote to cure them.[CR]You, as a syringe, must move about the screen, gathering antidotes and serums. Serums supposedly increase the strength of the antidote so you need less to cure someone. You must then aim at the infected person at the top or bottom of the screen and press your button to inject them. The longer you take to get the antidote to them, the more they will mutate and the more antidote it will require to cure them. Everything is not so simple, however, as there are normal alligators in the swamp and you will lose you a life if they touch you. You can shoot to kill them and it will not cost you an antidote.[CR]Some variations have walls that move. These make it harder to see the alligators, antidotes and serums. Serums only appear in variations with walls. Some variations allow you to pass through the walls, others will make the walls solid and they can crush you if you get between two closing ones. Once you cure all six friends, it is off to the next level.</plot>

				<title_clean>AndroMan on the Moon</title_clean>
				<plot>Androman on the Moon was one of several planned games for the unreleased Androman robot.  Although a few of the games were rumored to have been programmed, Androman on the Moon is the first one to actually surface.  Although the game itself may not look like much, one has to remember that it was only part of the package.  The real magic was with Androman himself.[CR]So what exactly was Androman?  Androman was a small white robot that would scurry about on a floor mat while the player controlled him using the Atari 2600.  Androman also had a barcode scanner in his bottom that would read barcodes placed on the map so the 2600 (and the robot) knew where he was.  Using a combination of the joystick and barcodes, the player could guide Androman around the floor mat and play various games.  One of those games being Androman on the Moon. [CR]So exactly what is Androman doing on the moon?  According to programmer Michael Case, Androman is mining minerals on the moon when he is attacked by aliens (don't you hate it when that happens?).  The giant floor mat would have the locations of the mines, and the player would have to guide Androman to them.  Once Androman was over a mine, the 2600 would show the mine maze portion of the game.  In the mine maze the player has to guide Androman (shown as an X) through the maze while avoiding the alien (shown as a green face). [CR]Androman isn't helpless however.  Unbeknownst to the aliens, Androman comes equipped with time bombs that he can drop behind him.  If timed right, the alien will be destroyed if it is near the bomb when it explodes.  However the aliens are very fast, and timing everything just right is difficult.  The best course of action is to hightail it towards the end of the mine before the alien can get you.  If the alien does catch Androman the screen will go black and the timer will countdown to zero, after this the game crashes.  The reason for this is that the 2600 is trying to output commands to Androman that would make him jerk around and make noise (to show that he has been hit).  Unfortunately there is no Androman robot to control so the game simply crashes. [CR]Once the player has made it through the mine, he enters a 3-D tunnel.  Here the player must avoid or shoot down large circular objects (Moon Bats) as they come flying towards the screen.  The tunnel will move about the screen as the player shifts to the left or right in some very nice looking 3-D effects.  As with the mine screen, if the player gets hit the game crashes. [CR]After the player reaches the end of the tunnel, he would have had to make Androman move back to his home base with the minerals he mined.  After which the whole cycle would start again (find a new mine and play the mine scene again).  Unfortunately we don't have an Androman to control, so the game simply crashes at the end of the tunnel.  Oh well. [CR]Androman on the Moon is an interesting game that shows how the 2600 could be expanded and enhanced through the use of sophisticated controllers (such as robots).  Unfortunately the game market was rapidly deteriorating, and the public wasn't very receptive to new ideas, especially anything that cost extra money.  The Androman idea wouldn't be seen again until Nintendo decided to try something similar with R.O.B.  Unfortunately R.O.B. met a similar fate after only two games.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/androman/androman.htm[CR]</plot>

				<plot>M.A.D. (which stands for Missile Attack and Defense) is an arcade action game somewhat similar to Missile Command. You control a photon cannon at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to protect six energy stations located to your left and right. Waves of rockets and other ships will fly by on the screen, and occasionally one will drop in an attempt to destroy one of the stations (as a warning on most levels, the enemy will turn white just before it drops). You need to make sure you shoot it before your energy station is destroyed! When all six energy stations are gone, the game is over. A two player variation is also included; one player will control the photon cannon, and the second player controls a cursor and can select when and where an enemy will drop. The players alternate between offense and defense in this version.</plot>

				<title_clean>Aquaventure</title_clean>
				<plot>Aquaventure is a bit of a mystery in the prototype world. It was never mentioned in any Atari press releases nor does it show up on any internal part lists.  Aquaventure seems to have popped out of the woodwork one day without any public fanfare nor any history behind its mysterious origins.  In any case, Aquaventure seems to be complete and ready for release, we can only speculate as to why it was shelved.[CR]The game concept is simple; you must dive to the bottom of an undersea cavern and retrieve a fabulous treasure (which just happens to look like a small house of some sort).  Along the way you must avoid fish, sea horses, and other underwater creatures attempting to block your path.  Your diver came prepared however, for he is armed with a spear gun which he can use to temporarily kill one of the creatures.  However, each enemy you kill is soon replaced by a faster and indestructible version of itself, so you need to carefully carve a path to the bottom only destroying the creatures that get in your way.  After retrieving the treasure and returning it to the top of the cavern, a mermaid will appear.  Touching the mermaid will take you to the next level, where you get to do it all over again.  At the top of the screen there is a turtle, which shows how much air you have left. If the turtle reaches the Air sign at the far end of the screen before you complete the level you loose a life. [CR]Aquaventure's main problem lies in its repetitive gameplay.  Each new level looks the same as the previous one, only with slightly different colors, faster fish and less time (air) to accomplish your goal.  But even with these new twists, there just isn't enough to keep the average person interested for very long.  Going up and down the same cavern all day gets old fast.  In its current state Aquaventure is a fine start, but it needs a few more gameplay elements to round it out a bit.  Why Aquaventure was abandoned instead of being fixed is still a mystery, but it's a shame since it's an interesting game with real potential.

				<title_clean>Armor Ambush</title_clean>
				<plot>Armor Ambush is a game that gives players control over tanks that battle one another over terrain that offers varying degrees of texture and traversability. Dueling tanks was a theme familiar to owners of the Atari 2600 since Combat, the game packaged with nearly every Atari 2600 system, had a very similar premise. However, Armor Ambush expands upon the simple battles available to players of Combat. The field of battle occupies a region greater than the size of the screen. Players are able to control two tanks and switch between them on command. The terrain is more diverse, featuring areas of foliage, water, and natural barriers. There is also a single-player mode that allows a player to battle a computer-controlled opponent.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armor_Ambush[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Artillery Duel</title_clean>
				<plot>In this two player game each player controls an artillery gun set in a mountain landscape with the goal of destroying the other player. Players take turns firing at each other; on each turn you have a limited amount of time in which the barrel angle and powder level can be set in order to control the direction and distance of the shot. When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of time you have to make a shot.</plot>

				<plot>Sky Jinks is a racing game that will have you weaving through pylons, trees and balloonists in an effort to finish one of five different courses as fast as possible. A top-down view of the course shows your P-41 plane and surrounding obstacles.[CR]Use the fire button to accelerate and joystick to bank left or right as you make your way through the air. Each race differs in the amount of pylons you'll have to pass through -- red pylons require you to fly to the right, while blue pylons must be passed on the left. Missing a pylon will cost you three seconds on the clock.</plot>

				<plot>A mothership drops aliens, up to three on screen at a time. There are ten per level. You must shoot them but avoid the items they fire at you. You fire by pushing up on the joystick. Pushing left or right makes you go left or right. If you hold down the button, pushing left or right makes you fire left or right.[CR]Later enemies will drop fireballs that chase you along the ground or split in two smaller enemies when shot. If you fire non-stop, you will build up heat as indicated by the green bar at the bottom right.[CR]If you overheat or are hit by an enemy, you loser a life. The game is over when you lose all lives or reach a score of 999,999. You get a new man (4 max) every 10,000 points.</plot>

				<plot>The year is 50 B.C. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, almost entirely... There is one Gaulish village, located near the Roman outposts of Totorum, Aquarium, Laudanum, and Compendium, that has resisted the Roman legions. According to reports from Roman spies, the villagers are led by two Gaulish heroes - Asterix and Obelix. [CR]The first hero, Asterix, is a shrewd little warrior with a quick mind and a large moustache. Asterix gets his superhuman strength from a magic potion brewed by the village Druid, Getafix. [CR]The other hero is Asterix's remarkably strong and hungry friend, Obelix. Obelix has a healthy appetite for wild boar, and is always ready for a good fight with the Romans. [CR]These two valiant heroes aren't afraid of anything. Except... well, except for one thing. The off-key tunes from the lyre of Cacofonix, the village bard, can make them retreat faster than a Roman can say "Veni, Vidi, Vici"! [CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Taz for the 2600 was slightly modified and sold as Asterix in Europe.[CR]http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=1965[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In this game, you control Marvin the Cube Master.

Marvin will then exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot move onto a space of the same color as he is.[CR]To rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the direction to rotate.[CR]The game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest moves.[CR]Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it rotates, so you don't know what color your on.[CR]Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict you rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces.[CR]Eight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.</plot>

				<plot>Grand Prix is a Formula One Grand Prix motor racing-themed video game, and one of the first side-scrolling racing video games. It was designed and programmed by David Crane for the Atari 2600 video game console, and published by Activision in 1982.[CR]Grand Prix was the first Atari 2600 game to feature shaded objects in color. When David Crane developed an Atari 2600 programming technique for painting large, multicolored sprites on the screen, he made a color pattern that reminded him of Grand Prix racing stripes. This inspired him to design a Grand Prix racing game to apply his new technique.</plot>

When the game starts, the bachelor has four lives. Every time he misses the Spanish Fly he loses one life and a musical theme is played. After each life is lost, you must depress the button again. When all the lives are lost the game is over. Small squares on the stripe at the bottom of the screen show how many lives are remaining in addition to the one then in play.[CR]~From the Manual[CR]</plot>

As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:[CR]All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.[CR]No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.[CR]A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.[CR]After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.[CR]If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.[CR]Difficulty switches[CR]Right:[CR]A=computer rolls dice for you[CR]B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers[CR]Left:[CR]A=computer sets up the board for you[CR]B=you can set the pieces where you want them.[CR]Game variations[CR]Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player[CR]Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player[CR]Games one through four are backgammon[CR]Games five through eight are acey deucey[CR]Games 1, 2, 5, and 6 have a doubling cube.</plot>

				<title_clean>Bank Heist</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]In Bank Heist, the player navigates a getaway car through a  maze-like city,  robbing banks while attempting to avoid the  police.  The player robs a bank by simply running over it; however, robbing a bank will cause a police car to appear and give chase.  Up to three police cars will be active at one time.  The player must avoid the police cars, or destroy them by dropping  dynamite in their path.  An exit path on the right side of the screen allows the player to move to a new city.  However, the getaway car has a limited amount of fuel.  Running out of fuel causes the player to lose a life, but the car is refueled a certain amount upon moving to a new city.  Robbing at least nine banks before leaving a city will cause the getaway car to be fully refueled upon changing cities. Points are tallied as money, which is earned by robbing banks, destroying police cars, or escaping a city having robbed nine or more banks.  The game select switch can be used to begin play at a later level.  [CR]Difficulty Switches [CR]Left Switch:  A: The cops will always chase the player.B: The cops will move according to a set patternRight Switch:  A: Banks will appear in random places.B: Banks will appear in set places.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR]A vast beam matrix has enshrouded the Earth. This glowing blue grid forms the Restrictor Shield, 99 sectors deep and teeming with hostile alien life. Your mission is to move through all sectors, destroying the enemy craft as you progress. Deeper sectors reveal new enemy types, each with their own method of impeding your success.The player's ship can only move left and right, travelling along one of five beams as the blue beam matrix scrolls towards them. The ship is armed a laser lariat and torpedoes, with the laser being the principle weapon. When the fire button is pressed, the laser will shoot along the beam the player is currently on. The main aim is to destroy all white saucers in a sector, causing the Sector Sentinel to appear. This can only be destroyed with a torpedo &#8211; three are given to the player at the start of each sector &#8211; and a successful hit awards bonus points before play progresses to the next sector.  [CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]  White Enemy Saucers      These are the main enemies you'll encounter. There are 15 in each sector, and you'll need to blast every one of them before you can progress. Saucers change up their attack pattern every few sectors e.g. dodging from left to right while spewing a string of bombs, or simply flying towards your ship in an attempt to ram you. Once you've destroyed all of the saucers in a sector a Sentinel craft will appear, giving you a chance to destroy it. Saucers appear from Sector 1.  Brown Space Debris      This rock-hard refuse will fly in a straight line down a beam at you. Normal laser fire will not damage it, so it can be avoided or destroyed with one of the three torpedoes you are given at the start of each life. Space debris starts appearing from Sector 2 onwards.    Yellow Chirper Ships      These mouthy aliens will announce their arrival with a twin-trill alert. They will then fly horizontally from one side of the screen to the other. Chirpers do not fire at your ship, and cannot collide with it. As such, they serve merely to provide bonus points for any player with a quick trigger finger. Chirpers start appearing from Sector 4.  Green Blocker Ships         Nigh-indestructible enemies that will streak in from the side of the screen, locking onto the beam that your ship is travelling down before trying to ram you. They must then either be avoided or destroyed with a torpedo, as they are impervious to regular laser fire. Although blockers can appear while clearing a sector of white saucers, they predominantly show up to protect a Sector Sentinel. On later levels, more and more green blockers will assault your craft, attempting to thwart any effort to blow up the Sentinel by blocking your torpedoes and causing you to switch beams to get a clear shot. Blockers start appearing as regular enemies from Sector 6.  Green Bounce Craft      This rotund enemy comes from the side of the screen and bounces horizontally across from one beam to the next, hoping to land on your ship to destroy it. If it is unsuccessful, it will bounce off the opposite side of the screen to return at another random interval. Regular lasers cannot harm it, so shoot it with a torpedo or try not to be on the beam it bounces on. Green bouncers appear from Sector 7.Blue Chargers      Chargers will zip down the screen at you along a random beam. They have two methods of attack, depending on what beam your ship is travelling on. If you're on the same beam as a charger when it reaches the bottom of the screen, it will collide with your ship and destroy it. If you're not on the same beam, the charger will wait for a few seconds before leaving the screen. During this small pause there is a chance that you will move sideways and onto the beam where the stationary charger is lurking, resulting in your death. While they aren't actually destroyed by your laser, firing a quick shot up the beam will cause a charger to bounce backwards into the distance from where it came. Chargers begin to appear from Sector 10.Orange Trackers      These devilish ships will track onto the beam your ship is flying along and attempt to ram you. Unlike green blockers, however, trackers will change beams to follow you should you try to avoid them. Initially, they will only change beam once to try and cause a collision. However, the further into the beam matrix you travel, the more intent the trackers will become; soon they will start to change course two or more times in their efforts. Additionally, they are invulnerable to common laser fire, meaning you'll need to be fast to avoid them or see them off with one of your precious torpedoes. Trackers start appearing at Sector 12.Red Zig Bombs      The final enemy to appear is one of the trickiest. Like the chirper, a Zig bomb will make a sound before making its way onscreen. When it does, it will find the beam your ship is on and start to come towards you. Zig bombs cannot be killed outright with regular laser fire, but they can be handled in various ways. If you manage to shoot a Zig bomb with your laser, it will change from red to green. It will then continue its flight down the beam it has chosen, before disappearing off the bottom of the screen. If, for whatever reason, you don't shoot the Zig bomb, it will travel down the beam before performing a last-minute flip across one beam towards your ship. This means if you fail to shoot the Zig, you should ensure that you are at least two beams away from it before it leaves the screen. Of course, the third method of taking a Zig out is to blast it with a torpedo. Zig bombs will appear from Sector 14 onwards.Sector Sentinel      Once all of the white saucers in a sector have been eliminated, an alarm will sound. The Sector Sentinel will then slide into view from either side of the screen. It will continue across the beam matrix horizon until it is either destroyed or leaves on the side opposite its starting position. During its migration, you can attempt to bring it down with any torpedoes you have in your stock. The higher the sector number, the more green blockers will flood onto the screen to prevent the Sentinel from being destroyed. A successful hit will cause the Sentinel to explode and bonus points are given depending on the number of lives you have accrued. Whether or not you destroy a Sentinel, the sector has been cleared and you move onto the next one. [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Asteroid Belt</title_clean>
				<plot>Classical Atari 2600 game! In Asteroid Belt you are flying - guess what -  through an asteroid belt. Typical for Atari is the lack of and ending, so you&#180;re shooting asteroids for points. You can fly and also shoot in four different directions and even control your speed. Sometimes there is a giant UFO trying to catch and kill you, so the fast speed is comming in handy, although you have to avoid the asteroids and flee from the giant UFO. [CR]This is one of the few non-popular Atari games amongst the universe of Atari Space-games that is really good.</plot>

				<plot>In the first stage, the player must fend off meteor showers from all four sides of the screen by pushing the joystick to fire in the desired direction. The second stage requires the player to pilot a shuttle to a planet and use its tractor beam to pick up life forms. While near the planet's surface, planetary defenses will fire at the shuttle. If hit, one previously captured specimen will be freed, forcing the player to retrieve another. After a set period of time, a klaxon will warn of renewed meteor activity, and the player must return immediately to defend the ark.</plot>

				<title_clean>Bloody Human Freeway</title_clean>
				<plot>Why did the chicken cross the road? So Activision could make a game about it of course! Even though Freeway looks a bit like Frogger at first glance, the two games are actually very different. According to David Crane, he got the idea for Freeway from watching a man trying to cross Lake Shore Drive during rush-hour traffic while attending Chicago's Consumer Electronic Show. [CR]Freeway originally featured people crossing the road instead of chickens since that was the scenario that inspired David Crane. However some people at Activision complained that they didn't like the idea of people being struck by cars, so chickens were substituted for people before the game was released.[CR]http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=2702[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Boggle is an unreleased game for the Atari 2600 programmed by David Crane while he was still working at Atari. In Boggle, which is based on the popular word game of the same name, you must form as many words as possible from a random 4x4 grid of letters. The 2600 version of the game is for two players only, and each player can form a maximum of eight words (likely due to memory constraints of the 2600). The game appears to be fairly close to completion, although there are some glitches, such as all the letters not appearing in the grid right away when you start the game. Still, it's an interesting prototype and it's unknown why Boggle was not completed and released.[CR]http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareID=4058[CR]</plot>

				<plot>This is a game rather reminiscent of Q*bert.[CR]In this game, you are a bubble named, with great originality, Bubble.[CR]The object here is to bounce on each of the thirty-six squares and turn them all on. You start at the bottom left. On the bottom right starts the Bubble Eater. He will chase you around the play field and if he catches you, you lose one of your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost.[CR]The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is popped, it turns into a glowing puddle for a short time. While it is a puddle, you can bounce on it without getting hurt.[CR]Game variations[CR]The game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]There are 5 waves per level.[CR]Level 1: The Bubble can bounce on any square and it will turn on and stay on.[CR]Level 2: The same as level 1 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.[CR]Level 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.[CR]Level 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce on it again it turns off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on again.[CR]Level 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.[CR]Level 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]You get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave.[CR]You score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points even if you are turning on a step a repeatedly.[CR]You get points for completing a level and/or wave. The amount varies by what level or wave you completed.</plot>

				<title_clean>Breakout</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The idea for Breakout originated circa 1975 when Atari founder Nolan Bushnell decided that they should release a version of the hit game Pong that could be played by a single player, as the first Pong featured no programmed AI.Atari assembled a team that included Pong designer Al Alcorn and future Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. The arcade cabinet was released in May 1976, the game was in black and white but featured colored plastic over the bricks.The game would go on to be ported to several platforms, including the Atari 2600 and Apple II.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Breakout, playerscontrol a paddle at the bottom of the screen, and the point is to hit a ball to the top of screen to break the bricks that are set in six different colored lines at the top. When players hit a brick in the top three colors the speed of the ball greatly increases, and when players hit the top of the screen past the bricks the paddle gets smaller. Both of these features combine to make the game much harder.The game requires paddle controls to play.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]While the game was a moderate success upon release, it was largely forgotten by the early 1980s. In 1986, however, Taito revived the Breakout style of gameplay with Arkanoid, which became a considerable success, launching its own Arkanoid franchise and inspiring numerous clones based on the same Breakout formula. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlimited Balls[CR]Choose any of the ''catch'' games and begin game play. Catch your last ball, press Select, then release the ball. Game play will continue in demonstration mode, with unlimited balls but no points scored.  [CR]</plot>

				<plot>Bridge is, of course, a computerized bridge game for one player. The computer controls both your partner and your opponents, either of which can be set to an expert or novice skill level. In the novice game, you will be able to see your partners hand while bidding while in the expert game your partners hand remains hidden. For each game, you can choose to play to either 13, 21, 25, or 29 points. After a hand is finished, you have the option of replaying the same hand if you want to practice, or you can have the computer deal a new hand. If you don't like the way a hand is going, you have the option of restarting the hand to try again. Included with the game instructions is a complete guide to how your computer partner will bid in different situations in order to help you form your strategy. Bridge was designed for people who already know how to play the game, it won't teach you how to play.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally released as Zoom 909 in Japan, this arcade game is a forward-scrolling, pseudo-3D, third-person rail shooter, released by Sega in 1982. Its gameplay is a precursor to Sega's 1983 laserdisc arcade game Astron Belt and 1985 arcade hit Space Harrier.[CR]The game released in both upright and cockpit cabinet versions. It released Japan and North America in 1982, and in Europe in 1983. The July 1983 issue of British magazine Computer &amp; Video Games noted that the setting resembles the Death Star in Star Wars.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Bump 'n' Jump</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bump 'N' Jump started as an arcade game developed by Data East, which was licensed to Bally Midway for its use in 1982. Its popularity spawned several console ports, the last being an NES version in 1988.In Bump 'N' Jump, players drive a red car down an open road at up to 220 MPH (or km/h in some versions). The main objective is to reach the gas station at the end of each roadway without crashing into obstacles, trees, or water. The road is filled with traffic of both light and heavy cars and trucks, some of which attempt to take the player's car out by bumping into it and sending it skidding to the side. Points are earned for progress made down the road, as well as bumping into other cars and sending them skidding off the road or into obstacles.A warning sign to jump. Jump! Once the player's car reaches 100 MPH, the car can jump high into the air. Around 40-50 MPH in speed will be lost by a single jump, so players will need to use some strategy to decide when it is most advantageous to utilize jumping. Jumping can come in handy to avoid skidding off the road when bumped, and also for avoiding patches of heavy traffic. Landing on enemy cars will destroy them and earn points.Countless broken bridges, water, slight curves, and splits also pose problems along the road. Well-timed jumps are often the only way to clear some obstacles such as broken bridges, and also are the easiest way to clear most water hazards. Because timing is essential for clearing major hazards, a warning beep sounds and a "!" will appear at the top of the screen when a hazard requiring a jump is imminent (though some hazards may still have safe causeways on one side). Landing on islands in the middle of water or bridge hazards will earn bonus points.At the end of a roadway, the number of enemy cars taken out is added to the player's score as bonus points, usually 300 to 500 points per car. In the event no enemies were crashed during the roadway, a significantly large bonus of 50,000 points will be awarded.As with most retro games, the game ends once the player exhausts all their lives.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Roadways in Bump 'N' Jump are based off seasons. Once a player completes the first roadway, they start a Spring stage, then progress to a Summer stage, and so on, moving and repeating through all the seasons. The colors in these stages reflect their represented season, and offer little other change beyond increasing difficulty.The variation of roadways varies between versions. In the arcade version, after the first three roads, the game begins a cycle of five roadways in order, repeating indefinitely until game over. The Intellivision version claims to have 32 unique roadways, while the Atari 2600 version has only eight (perhaps in the same manner as the arcade version).[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Differentiating every type of enemy car can be difficult, especially in console versions with lower detailed graphics. For the sake of simplicity, it is best to assume that any cars not mentioned here are light, may weave back and forth on the road in a non-hostile manner, and will skid a long way if hit.The more important cars to watch for are listed below.TractorThe tractor is often mistaken as a tank by players, as it has large treads and a dark green appearance in some console versions. The tractor drives in a straight line, and is extremely slow and easy to pass. Bumping a heavy tractor will barely budge it, and will send the player skidding further than usual. For this reason, caution should be used when passing tractors on narrow sections of road.Skull CarOne skull car and two dump trucks.The skull car is obvious in appearance, as it has a large skull and crossbones on its roof. When the players gets near a skull car, it will usually move toward the player, attempting to bump them off the road and generally get in the way. While this is far more dangerous in writing than in practice, poorly-timed encounters with a skull car can cause bumping that slows a player down at a crucial moment, ruining a necessary jump. The same warning applies to narrow roads and splits, especially when trying to navigate around other vehicles.Dump TruckArguably the most dangerous enemy in the game, the dump truck often moves faster than the player's top speed, and will dump out piles of debris that can crash the player if hit. Dump trucks only move in a straight line, and often must be watched closely while engaging other traffic. Simply touching a dump truck will destroy it -- an important fact to keep in mind if shooting for the 50,000 point no-kill bonus.During the first roadway, and select seasons afterwards (depending on version), the dump truck will make its dumping animation, but won't actually dump any debris onto the road.White CarThe white car is not as aggressive as the skull car, but will move towards the player and attempt to interfere upon approach. As with the skull car, care must be taken to avoid letting the white car botch jump speed and timing.Yellow TruckIn more graphically detailed versions, this truck may be blue with a yellow front. Otherwise, it looks like a pure yellow heavy-duty dump truck. The yellow truck is appropriately heavy, much like the tractor, but also weaves across the road frequently, making it tougher to simply dodge.[CR][B]Difficulty:[/B][CR]While Bump 'N' Jump is not a difficult game to learn by any means, its difficulty varies from system to system. Successfully completing roadways often necessitates rote memorization, as the top-down view makes knowledge of upcoming splits and twists in hazards impossible. This is especially true in later stages, where the player may be required to time landings on small islands in the middle of hazards before jumping again, without knowing what speed is necessary to hit the island.Some versions of the game are also stingy in handing out lives. The Intellivision version only explicitly promises one extra life at 20,000 points, and makes no mention of other opportunities for extra lives. In the arcade and Atari 2600 versions, where extra lives are awarded every 30,000 points, the best way to maintain a healthy supply of lives is by earning the 50,000 no-kill bonus as often as possible.[CR]NES version[CR]The NES version of Bump 'N' Jump came out in 1988, far later than earlier versions, and exhibits significant differences over its predecessors in both difficulty and storyline.A plot is added in which the protagonist's girlfriend has been kidnapped by generic thugs, who he pursues over 16 stages. The seasons concept is thrown out for a more diversely themed set of stages, featuring cityscapes, beaches, and cliffsides. Some stages also contain bonus air targets, which can be hit at the peak of a jump.The difficulty for this version is also much higher, with only three lives available to start and very high score thresholds to attain extra lives. In addition, P-fuel cells need to be gathered along the road, in order to keep a rapidly-depleting fuel tank full. Running out of fuel costs a life, which makes the process of surviving all the more bothersome. A few recharge stations can be entered in certain stages throughout the game, which starts a lengthy button mashing bonus sequence to regain P-fuel.Upon reaching the end of stage 16, the player engages in a boss fight with the enemy car carrying his girlfriend. Running out of P-fuel here does not kill the player, but renders them unable to jump regardless of speed. After the boss is jumped on enough times and destroyed, a cutscene plays, and the 16 stages begin all over again.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 50,000 Bonus Points[CR]While progressing through a course, do not destroy anyone. At the end you will be awarded 50,000 points.</plot>

				<title_clean>BurgerTime</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Title screen.[CR]Burgertime is an Arcade game originally released in 1982. A single-screen platformer game, the stages are a series of platforms with sections that are made of components of a mighty hamburger. These ingredients are placed in the level vertically so that, as the player character walked across them, they would drop until eventually making a complete sandwich at the bottom of the screen. The finished burgers are such titans that it dwarfs the player character. Of note, the servers who would carry this burger to the customers are never shown.[CR]The player controls Peter Pepper, a chef whose objective is to walk, climb and scurry all over the platforms in order to build his burgers. As the chef walks completely across the top of a layer, it will drops one level below, thus knocking the layer beneath down one level also. After all the layers have been dropped onto the platters awaiting below, the burger is complete and the player's score is boosted. When all hamburgers are completed, only then is the level clear. [CR]As with most of the games of the time, the levels become more complex and difficult as the player progresses. This is accomplished through varied platform layouts, more enemies, and an ever-increasing number of burger components. Just like in real life, no-one orders a plain cheeseburger forever. While the chef fights to keep his customers fed and happy, he is besieged by three malcontents of the food industry: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle and Mr. Egg. These 3 can be killed temporarily by dropping a layer of the burger on top of them but it is a short-term solution as they reappear at the edge of the screen after a short time. A crafty chef can also make the fiends chase him across a partially walked across layer and then complete it as the enemy steps on to it. The layer will then drop along with the enemy whose weight causes it to drop two levels as opposed to just one. An added benefit to this technique is that it temporarily stuns the enemy. It's possible to crush other enemies beneath the falling enemy and burger as well. Peter Pepper also has a small supply of pepper he can throw in the enemies face to render them harmless for a few seconds. Additional pepper can be acquired by picking up ice cream and other items that will randomly spawn on the level.[CR]PizzaTime, the hotly anticipated sequel was in development when the video game market went into a decline, and sadly was never released.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You must catch pastries from six conveyor belts before they fall on the floor. Each pastry caught is boxed and put behind you. Sometimes, a knife and fork come down the conveyor belt. If you are hit by the utensils or miss a pastry, the janitor has to clean it up. If he has to clean up too many times, he gets upset and storms out and game over.[CR]You can push the button to stop a conveyor belt for about four seconds but if you stop a second one, the first belt starts right back up. On games with belt speed up, you can push right on the joystick to speed up the belt you are in front of.[CR]At the end of each level, you will have a cup of coffee come down the belt, but not fall off the end. When you grab the cup, you get and extra clean-up (life) and the next level begins.[CR]Difficulty switches[CR]Set the left switch to A to start at level five. Set to B to start at level one. The right switch is not used.[CR]The are game variations that force the baker to pause when transferring boxes, making it harder, variations that allow belt speedup, variations with fast moving bakers and variations with all gingerbread men.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1987 by Epyx for a large number of systems, California Games was a collection of minigames based around outdoor activities in non-traditional sports. In most versions of the game, the player chose to compete in individual events or an event series. Unlike Epyx previous games, in which players chose a nationality, players get to choose a sponsor. The Commodore 64, for example, includes Maxx-Out, Costa Del Mar, Kawasaki, Santa Cruz, Ocean Pacific, Casio, Auzzie, Spin Jammer, and Ray-D-O, while the NES release adds publisher Milton Bradley to the roster.As a multi-platform game, the visual fidelity of California Games really depends on the machine that is powering it. In general, the art style was heavily informed by Californian imagery. The footbag event has the Golden Gate Bridge as a backdrop. On other platforms where space was at a premium, events were sacrificed. The Atari Lynx and 2600 releases only included four of the events: BMX, surfing, footbag, and halfpipe.Each event featured a different soundtrack, including some renditions of well known hits. Richard Berry's song "Louie Louie" accompanies the titles, while The Safari's hit "Wipe Out" sounds out during the surfing event.[CR]Events[CR]SurfingSet under a crashing pipeline wave, players gain speed to do aerial tricks and avoid falling off their board. Most versions of the game rate the player on a 10.0 scale, though some give points to the number of rotations in an aerial trick.HalfpipePlayers are given a time limit in which to earn points for rotation and hand plant tricks in a skateboarding half pipe. Not only must they execute these tricks, but they must turn their board in time to descend the ramp and keep momentum into the next trick.Flying DiskThis event requires throwing a frisbee to a partner off the screen. Players time their button presses to a meter to execute angle and speed and, once released, gain control of the offscreen player the catch the flying disk. Points are earned for successful catches.BMXPlayers ride along a dirt track with ramps and obstacles, doing wheelies, flips and spins to earn points. They are also judge on the time it takes to reach the goal, which can be impeded by falling off the bike or crashing.FootbagJuggling a hackysack with feet, head, and body, players must keep the bag from touching the ground while doing fancy moves to earn more points. Players can hit seagulls with the bag for bonus points.Roller SkatingPlayers skate along a path running parallel to the beach, doing tricks and spins while avoiding obstacles on the sidewalk.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Two aircraft (yours and your opponent's) fly over a canyon filled with layers of colorful bricks, a la Breakout. Using the fire button on your paddle controller, you earn points by dropping bombs into the canyon and destroying as many blocks as possible. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.[CR]This game is extremely limited in that it is played using only the paddle controller's fire button. You do not control the movement of the planes and helicopters, but rather you must time your shots to do the most damage.[CR]The cartridge includes a secondary variation titled "Sea Bomber" that is a little more interactive. In this game, you deploy bombs onto seafaring ships, but this time you can use the paddle controller's knob to determine the depth of the bombs.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Control the game with the joysticks[CR]Even though Canyon Bomber utilizes the paddle controllers, you can use the joysticks to control the ''Land Bomber'' games. Just press Left to shoot with the red planes, and Right to shoot with the yellow planes.</plot>

				<title_clean>Care Bears</title_clean>
				<plot>The Atari 2600 was no stranger to games designed specifically for children.  Although Atari had capitalized on the idea that young children could play video games just as well as their older siblings (if the games were sufficiently simplified), almost no other companies decided to follow suit.  Parker Brothers was one of the few exceptions to this rule, and decided to give the children market a try.  While Atari bought up most of popular licenses such as Peanuts, Sesame Street, The Muppets, and Disney, Parker Brothers had to make due with lesser known, but still popular, characters such as Strawberry Shortcake and The Care Bears. [CR]The game concept in Care Bears revolves around grabbing the "Tummy Icon" from each of the Care Bears as they slowly fell down the screen.  Once all the icons were collected the player would have to arrange them in a certain order before time ran out.  Although this may sound rather easy, one has to keep in mind that the game was geared toward young children, so things had to be kept simplistic.  [CR]Care Bears made it to the beta testing stage before the marketing department decided to stop work on the game citing that the market for childrens games was diminishing, and the gameplay was too dull.  Therefore it was decided that all further development on the game was to be stopped, and Care Bears was quietly killed (figuratively, not literally).  According to Laura, part of the reason Care Bears was killed off was that the marketing department really didn't know what they wanted.  The Care Bears product line was aimed at the 8 and under age group, but marketing wanted a more action oriented game designed for older kids.  Marketing being out of touch with the real world was a common theme in the 80's game industry, and is partially blamed for the death of some of the biggest game companies such as Atari. [CR]Although Laura described the game as being almost finished, the only known prototype to surface is nothing more than a graphics demo.  The prototype shows two Care Bears (minus the Tummy Icons) floating on a screen with some clouds in the background.  The top Care Bear slowly moves left to right around the screen until he wraps around, while the lower Care Bear can be moved left or right by the player.  Beyond this, there is nothing else to do in this prototype.  The only other thing to note is that when the player reaches the far right of the screen, the screen will extend downwards a few scanlines.  This is most likely a programming bug rather than an indication of any planned gameplay.[CR]While most collectors won't mourn the loss of a childrens game (especially one geared towards young girls), Care Bears is an interesting example of how some game designers attempted to break the mold and try something new.  It is hoped that Laura's almost complete version of Care Bears can be found one day. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/carebear/carebear.htm[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Chase the Chuckwagon</title_clean>
				<plot>Gameplay:[CR]Chase the Chuck Wagon is a maze game where the player must guide a dog through a maze in order to reach a chuckwagon.[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]As part a promotion involving the Chuck Wagon line of dog food, Purina contracted video game developer Spectravision to create a game themed around dogs and dog food. Customers could redeem proofs of purchase from bags of dog food in exchange for the game, an example of a new marketing technique that emerged during the popularity of video games in the early 1980s. In practice, the promotion was relatively unsuccessful, and the game is nowadays something of a collector's item. The unshipped cartridges were destroyed.[CR]Among Collectors:[CR]The game has something of a reputation among collectors of Atari video games. It is far from the rarest of games for the Atari 2600, yet the mystique surrounding its history grants it a disproportionate amount of interest. It is commonly referred to as the Holy Grail of Atari 2600 video game collecting.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_the_Chuck_Wagon[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Checkers</title_clean>
				<plot>Checkers is a computerized version of the popular board game and follows the same rules; the object of the game is to remove all of your opponents pieces from the 8x8 game board. This is accomplished by moving your pieces diagonally forward on the board; an opponents piece is removed from play if one of your pieces jumps over it (if any of your pieces are able to jump an opponents piece, you must make that move). When beginning the game pieces can only move in a diagonal forward direction until they reach the other side of the board; that piece then becomes "kinged" allowing movement both forwards and backwards. The game can be played by one player against the computer (with three skill levels available) or two players against each other.</plot>

				<plot>The Spectra Island reactor provides power for millions of residents. Ordinarily, there is no problem but there has been an earthquake. This has damaged the reactor, causing it to release radioactive particles. You must use the robot arm to retrieve these particles before the radiation builds too much and we have a meltdown.[CR]There are three sections per screen. They are colored, from top to bottom, red, blue and yellow. You start with one particle in each area and you must move the robot arm to intercept these particles, pushing the fire button to grasp them when they get to the robot arm.[CR]If you delay to long, however, the particles will split as they bounce around, causing the radiation level to build. If the radiation builds too much, you lose one robot arm. In later levels, you also must avoid hitting the circulating fans, as this will also destroy the robot arm. The game ends when you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.</plot>

				<plot>You're piloting a helicopter gunship, flying cover for a truck convoy of medical supplies through enemy territory. Suddenly, your long-range scanner shows squadrons of enemy aircraft closing in on your position. You throw the control stick forward and your chopper shoots skyward, barely avoiding a cluster of multi-warhead missiles. Your response is swift, as you pivot your gunship 180 degrees, unleashing a lightning barrage of laser rockets. The action: furious. The concentration: intense. You are engaged in one of the most demanding video battles ever conceived. You must rely on your long-range scanner, your wits, and your reflexes. Because it's your responsibility to see that those supplies get through. So, take charge - you're at the controls, with Chopper Command, by Activision!</plot>

				<title_clean>Chuck Norris Superkicks</title_clean>
				<plot>In this action game you play the part of Chuck Norris on a quest to reach a monastery where an important leader is kept hostage. The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Coconuts is a game for the Atari 2600 developed and published by Telesys and programmed by Jim Rupp. The object of the game is to guide an explorer, Stanley, away from the coconuts being dropped by the monkey, Coco. To help defend himself, Stanley is carrying an umbrella and wearing a pith helmet to deflect some of the projectiles. However, each time he takes a hit one of these objects will disappear. These defenses can be regained when the player reaches scores of 500 and 1500 points. As the game continues, Coco will get angrier and angrier and start to speed up his attacks.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In Codebreaker your goal is to guess a 3 or 4 digit secret code which is generated by either the computer or another player. Depending on the difficulty setting, the player has either 8 or 12 guesses to figure out the code by entering in values with the keyboard controller. After each guess, the computer analyzes your input and displays results which indicate if you have a correct digit in the correct position, a correct digit in the wrong position, or no correct digits at all. Points are scored based on how many turns it takes to correctly identify the code. A second game variation called Nim is also included. In this game, two players take turns removing items from a stack. On each turn, a player must take at least one item from a stack, and the player who removes the last item from the screen wins. You can have the computer set up the stacks automatically or set them up manually, and a variation is included where the player who removes the last item from the screen loses rather than wins.</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Combat, an             Atari 2600 launch title, is a duel based game consisting of three main modes, with many variations therein.[CR]Tank Combat[CR] The first mode is              tank combat, where players control tanks that are either stuck in a              maze or out in the open. Options in this mode contain what can be considered a very funny mode, Tank Pong! Combined with invisible tanks (that only show when they fire) and one of the two mazes, reflecting cannon shots provide for some unusually intense and hilarious stand-offs.  It's especially entertaining when you manage to fire a round right when the timer runs out, because the projectile will continue its course, bouncing off the walls with a menacing yet musical tone increasing with each bounce, while both tanks are stuck in place, awaiting their fate.  You could be lucky and score an extra hit![CR]Bi-Plane Combat[CR] The second mode is  bi-plane combat.  Players command one or several airplanes in an open field, which may have obscuring clouds behind which players can change direction to throw off opponents.  With formations, players fly side-by-side with identical airplanes that act as one, always maintaining a line abreast formation that would be difficult to manage in the light of physics, as the straggler would always be behind.  These formations allow for a greater amount of projectiles to be fired, but also increases the chance that the player's planes will be hit, as the entire formation shares in the hit detection.  Finally there's a bomber mode, where a formation of three bi-plane fighters are pitted against a large bomber, which is basically just a large distortion of the basic bi-plane model.  The bomber fires a large projectile, while the fighters fire a spread of three.  Odds tend to favor the fighters, because of this.[CR]Jet Combat[CR] The final mode is  jet combat.  It's very similar to bi-plane combat, except there is no "bomber" level, and the vehicles move across the screen much faster.All three have guided missiles as an option, which turn as the player turns.  This can be especially deadly in the air stages, as it's like having a formation of projectiles. One notable bug in the tank game was that if you rammed your tank against the outer wall, sometimes it would slip through to the other side.  A great way to sneak up on the enemy!  [CR]Launch Game [CR]Combat was a North American launch game for the          Atari 2600 on October 1977. The game launched alongside other 2600 launch titles that included: *         Air-Sea Battle*        Basic Math*       Blackjack*      Indy 500    *     Star Ship    *    Street Racer*   Surround    *  Video OlympicsNine launch games in total for the Atari 2600 near the end of the disco age.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flying tanks[CR]Select game 9 and start the game like normal. Rotate the tank on the left 180 degrees and fire. If done correctly, the shot will bounce around the screen and hit the right tank. Both tanks should fly approximately three screens to the left before stopping. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flying tanks[CR]Keep a hold of Reset on the console and the fire button on the joystick to make your tank shoot to the other side of the screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flying tanks[CR]Select game 9 and start the game like normal.  Then rotate the tank that is on the right 180, then fire.  If it's done correctly, both of the tanks should switch positions.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flying tanks[CR]Place your tank just to the right of the top left corner and fire into that corner. The shot will leave the screen and re-appear from the top right corner.</plot>

				<plot>The year is 2037. Nations no longer fight monster wars, killing millions. Instead, two combatants enter an arena and fight for their countries honor.[CR]This is a sequel to the 1977 game Combat however, there are no planes, just tanks and missiles. Each player starts in a base in a corner, one in the upper left, the other in the lower right. You must seek out your opponent and shoot them three times to destroy their tank. If they are under trees or, in another game variation, behind walls, you must shoot the trees/walls out of the way first to reach them. Each player has three tanks. The winner is the last one standing.[CR]If you are still in your base, you can press the button to fire a homing missile that will seek out you opponent. When the homing missile hits, it counts as two shots. Missiles must reload between shots and the reloading time is several seconds. If a tank is not hit for several seconds, the 'crew' will affect repairs.[CR]There are game variations for trees, which you can drive but not shoot through, walls, which you can neither drive nor shoot through   and versions where you can place the trees/walls where you would like them to be.</plot>

				<plot>Your city is under attack by commando raiders, and it's your job to defend it! You control a large gun at the bottom of the screen. Choppers will be flying in paratroopers, both of which need to be destroyed. If a paratrooper makes it past your fire and lands, it will damage and eventually destroy one of the buildings in the city. After a building is destroyed, the paratroopers will then begin tunneling towards your gun in an effort to destroy it. Occasionally an airplane will fly by and drop a large bomb. The bomb needs to be shot before it lands, or it can destroy the entire city! The game ends when your gun is destroyed by a bomb or a paratrooper.</plot>

				<title_clean>Confrontation</title_clean>
				<plot>Confrontation is a strange strategy game which was never commercially released, but was available directly from Answer for a short time.  Only people who saw it on display at the 1983 CES show would have know about it and ordered it so while it's not technically a prototype, it's close enough.  I've racked my brain on how to best describe the gameplay of this game, and after much searching I've determined the best description is in Leonard Herman's "ABC's to the VCS" (pick up a copy today!).  Since Confrontation uses a programming trick to display so many objects on the screen at once, screenshots will only show one players pieces at a time.  Take my word for it, they're really all there.[CR]Confrontation is a very unique game which can only be played by two opposing players.  In this unusual chess-like game, each player controls four pawns and a captain.  The blue player's pawns are lined up vertically along the left border of the playfield while the red player's pawns are along the right. Blue's Captain is at the top center of the playfield and red's is at the bottom.  The object of the game is to move your four pawns to the opposite side of the board where they will be removed.  Once all of your pawns are gone, you must get your captain over to your opponent's side of the board and remove it also.  The first player to remove all of his pieces wins the game. [CR]Moving the pieces is also an unusual process.  Each player controls a bar which runs horizontally across the width of the playfield.  You must place the bar over the piece that you wish to move.  You must then press the red firing button once if you wish to move a pawn and twice if you want to move your captain.  Once your piece is 'locked in' you can move it either horizontally or vertically.  However your piece cannot move over a spot which is already occupied by another piece.  Your Captain has the ability to move into a space occupied by one of your opponent's pawns.  If this occurs, you will send his pawn back to its starting position. [CR]While you move your pieces, you'll constantly use up your energy which is monitored at the top and bottom of the screen.  When you are completely out of energy you'll be immobilized for three seconds, allowing your opponent to move pieces without any trouble.  At the end of the three seconds, your energy will be completely recharged.  Throughout the game a pod will move around the playfield with the letter 'E' flashing on and off.  If you touch it while the letter appears you'll be receive a full supply of energy no matter how much you might have remaining.[CR]Confrontation is a highly original strategy game in an era when fast paced action and shooting games were all rage.  If more innovative games like this had been released the crash of 83-84 may not have happened.  But as we all know the video game industry was done in by bad clone after bad clone, and Answer Software was not immune to its effects.  Games like Confrontation were left in dust, never even reaching store shelves.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/confrontation/confrontation.htm[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The players will take control of the Astrobus, a futuristic flying bus that has the capability to hold up to 8 commuters. The players will start of each level where they will have to land the Rocket Module, if they land to hard the module with blow up and the level will restart. Once the Rocket Module has landed safely on the ground then it detaches the Astrobus. The game does not feature a timer, however the Astrobus can run out of fuel so player will have to keep their eye out for fuel-pickups along the route. Just because there are to time limits does not mean that the players have all the time in the world, the commuters will not wait for ever and they will leave after some time so the player will have to hurry and pick them all up. When all the commuters have been picked up the next step is to return to the Rocket Module. Along the route the players will encounter obstacles that they can choose to destroy or to avoid, destroying them will give points but will slow the players down on their way to the commuters. Players will start the game with 3 buses at their disposal, and can earn a new bus each 10,000 points.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Cosmic Corridor</title_clean>
				<plot>LOST IN A FAR AWAY GALAXY[CR]The expression "Lost in Space" takes on new meaning when it happens to you.   You're suspended in time - caught in hostile space between the edges of the galaxy where only your best star cruiser navigational skills can bring you home.  And as if that's not bad enough, you are under constant attack from all sorts of space vermin from alien monsters to rogue fighters.  Keep your wits about you and your turbo lasers blasting and maybe you'll have a chance.[CR]MOVING YOUR CANNON[CR]Your laser cannon moves in the same direction that you move the joystick - up, down, left or right.  Firing is a little bit different.  Move the joystick in the direction you'd like to fire, but you don't have to hold it there because the target computer will aim in that direction until you change it.  For rapid fire, hold the action button down.[CR]GAME SELECTION[CR]GAME 1:  The easiest of the four variations.  For one player only.[CR]GAME 2:  The second most difficult variation.  For one player only.[CR]GAME 3:  The third most difficult variation.  For one player only.[CR]GAME 4:  The hardest of the four variations.  Don't start on this variation unless you're an arcade ace!  For one player only.[CR]SCORING[CR]Depending on which aliens you destroy, they're worth 30 or 40 points.[CR]GAME FEATURES[CR]At the beginning of each game, you start off with six laser-cannons.  You can be destroyed if you steer into the side of the corridor, if you're shot by an alien, or if you crash into one.  The number of cannons you have left is displayed at the top of the screen, under the score.[CR]BLASTING MORE ALIENS[CR]Some strategical advice:  keep that Fire Button down all the time, and when nothing is on the screen, aim up.  This way you won't be caught by surprise.   And when everything looks hopeless and a slew of bullets is heading toward you, change directions from up or down or vice versa.  Sure, it's a last resort, but sometimes the bullets will take a slightly different curve and miss you.[CR]~From the Manual[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You are at the Waypoint Interstellar Trade Depot, a quiet outpost in space, when suddenly a dormant group of alien, mineral-eating termites awakens. They then begin haphazardly making their nest.[CR]Using your probe ship, you must destroy the termites and their nest blocks. You simply fire at the termites to destroy them but their nest blocks must be energized before you can destroy them. To energize a nest block, you must hit a block while a termite is still carrying it. This will energize all the blocks on the screen.[CR]If you shoot a termite that is not carrying a block or if one is carrying a block but you only hit the termite, all the blocks will not be energized and not be damageable. If you run into a block, energized or not, or are touched by a termite, you lose a life.[CR]Every so often, a refuel ship travels down and then back up the left or right side of the screen. You must dock with it (touch it) before it gets back to the top or the game ends, no matter how many lives you have left.[CR]To fire, press the fire button. To move, move the joystick while the button is not pressed. If you hold down the button, you can rotate left or right then you will stay at that angle until you rotate again.[CR]The points are:[CR]Shooting a termite that is NOT carrying a block=1 point[CR]Shooting a termite that is carrying a block but only hitting the termite=2 points[CR]Shooting a termite that is carrying a block and hitting the block=3 points[CR]Shooting an energized block=1 point</plot>

				<plot>The immense WAYPOINT interstellar trade depot floats with its tiny crew at a distant crossroads between the stars. It should be a quiet place to command. But beware -- a dormant colony of giant, alien, mineral-eating termites hidden in ore holding section seven have awakened! The Termites invade the main power-conversion chamber and begin assembling a haphazard nest. Your crew is working feverishly, opening the crates of tiny remote-controlled planetary-probe ships. It's up to you to pilot a fragile probe ship into the power chamber and clear out the invaders before they jam it totally. By docking with your refueling ship when necessary, and by energizing the nest blocks so your probe ship's fire can destroy them, you may be able to prevail against the invaders and save WAYPOINT.</plot>

But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.[CR]You get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site.</plot>

				<title_clean>Crazy Climber</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Crazy Climber is a 1980 Nihon Bussan arcade game in which the player must scale a tall building while avoiding dangers during their ascent. It is in some part inspired by the "Human Fly" craze of the late 70s.[CR]The game was eventually released on the Famicom in 1986 and came bundled with a special controller that allowed the player to control both arms of the climber. It was also available on other home systems, such as the Atari 2600.[CR]It is one of Nichibutsu's most highly acclaimed video games in its library. A precursor to the platformer genre, Crazy Climber was the first game revolving around climbing, specifically climbing buildings, before Nintendo's seminal 1981 release Donkey Kong.[CR][B]Lives:[/B][CR]The player is awarded 3 lives at the beginning of each games. An extra life is given after the players reaches 30,000 points.[CR][B]Score:[/B][CR]For every story of the building climber, the player scores1st Building - 100 points2nd Building - 150 points3rd Building - 200 points4th Building - 250 pointsBonus Points[CR]Bonus points are awarded when after successfully climbing each building and the climber is carried off by the helicopter. However, the bonus score decreases every ten seconds that the climber spends ascending the building.1st Building - 10,000 points2nd Building - 20,000 points3rd Building - 30,000 points4th Building - 40,000 points[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]An Arcadia 2100 port was in the works, but never got released.Musical themes in the game include Baby Elephant Walk, The Pink Panther and The Entertainer.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]In 1981, Bandai Electronics manufactured a hand-held VFD version of the game.The game has also been ported to the Atari 2600 and the Japanese Famicom.A Japanese-only sequel, Crazy Climber 2, was produced in 1988. The game was essentially identical to Crazy Climber in gameplay but featured more sophisticated graphics and a few new features.On February 3, 1996, Hyper Crazy Climber was released only in Japan for the PlayStation. It has similar gameplay to that of the original game but also a few differences. Players can choose between three cartoony characters, each with their own strength/speed attributes. Several buildings can be selected from a Bomberman-style map screen, including an underwater building, a medieval clock tower, a haunted skyscraper, and a beanstalk. Power-ups are also used.On March 2, 2000, Crazy Climber 2000 was released for the PlayStation. This is more of a remake of the original arcade game using 3D graphics for the first time. A notable feature is the ability to turn corners and access different sides of the buildings, which now have a variety of designs (including one with a cylindrical, tower-like shape). The game included the original port of the arcade Crazy Climber and a scan of the instruction panel. Like Hyper Crazy Climber which released for the same console 4 years earlier, Crazy Climber 2000 was released only in Japan.On July 21, 2005, Japanese publisher HAMSTER released the arcade version of Crazy Climber under their Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono (&#12458;&#12524;&#12383;&#12385;&#12466;&#12540;&#12475;&#12531;&#26063;) classic game line for the PlayStation 2.Another sequel or remake, Crazy Climber Wii was released for the Wii in Japan on December 20, 2007, but no North American or European release date has been confirmed.The arcade game was later re-released on the Virtual Console in Japan on February 23, 2010.[CR] [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Broken eggs[CR]Press the Select button when the eagle drops eggs.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Broken eggs[CR]Press the Select button before the opening song ends to stop it on its final note.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Broken eggs[CR]While you are climbing, hanging, or falling, press Select to pause the game.

				<plot>It seems as if forever that the evil Morplus from the planet Tzoris have terrorized the galaxy, leaving death and destruction in their wake. But now, our scientists have developed our newest weapon, the Spectron! You will be deployed with this weapon and must destroy as many Morplus as you can.[CR]You have two lasers, one at the top that fires down and one at the bottom that fires up. You control both lasers. Depending on what you select, you can have both lasers stay parallel to each other or move opposite of each other. Your goal is to fire the laser, which fires from one laser to the other, and destroy any enemies caught in your crossfire. The mothership that drops the enemies is indestructible.[CR]Be aware, however, that if you fire you weapon non-stop, it will overheat and then will not fire until it cools a little. Also be aware of the amount of fuel you have because if you run out of fuel, you lose one life. You need to shoot any red fuel pods when they appear on screen.</plot>

				<title_clean>Crossbow</title_clean>
				<plot>Crossbow is Exidy's first light gun arcade game, released in 1983. It was the first arcade game to utilize digitized sound and speech.Gameplay[CR]Players are tasked with protecting various adventurers through shooting enemies and obstacles with the crossbow light gun. Adventurers (known as Friends in the game) walk from one side of the screen to the other, while various enemies appear. The player must take care not to shoot Friends, or they will become injured. While Friends are not completely defenseless, they are easily killed by the game's various dangers.After the first stage, an overworld map is introduced, showing the games eight stages. Rather than selecting a stage, players are directed to shoot large blocks at the bottom of the screen to choose a colored path. There is no indication of which stage the path leads to, but it remains consistent, so they can be memorized.After certain stages, a new Friend is added. As long as a single Friend makes it safely to the other side of the screen, gameplay continues. The final stage culminates in a battle with the head of Satan, which shoots lighting from his eyes. The player must successfully shoot out each eye, and protect any Friends by shooting lighting bolts to restart gameplay. Subsequent playthroughs are more difficult, but Friends remain.Gameplay ends when all Friends are killed.[CR]Remakes[CR]Though not directly ported, the game was remade for various console systems and home computers years later. An iPhone version was released in 2010.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>There are eight moving and shooting directions on the joystick. You can fire by controlling the direction on the joystick and pressing the red button.[CR]There are two parts in this game - above ground and underground. The UFO is under your control. Press the "RESET" button to start. You have altogether 8 UFOs. There are two kinds of cannon towers on the ground, the high ones and the low ones. You will get 20 points by hitting the low one and 50 points by hitting the firing part of the higher one. Note: When moving the UFO, move it slowly and gradually. Keep the UFO in the upper-left corner after you finish shooting.[CR]After hitting 10 towers, an underground tunnel will show up. You have three chances to enter the tunnel. If you stay outside, the firing speed of the towers will double. To pass the path, first, move your UFO to the right of the screen then down to the left with equal speed. Keep the UFO as close to the ground as possible and you will be much safer. If you do not want to enter the tunnel, you can avoid enemy's firing by returning to the upper-left corner position. [CR]The underground tunnel will become narrower as time goes by. You can get 50 points by hitting a tower. As the number of the towers you hit increases, the points you get for hitting a new tower increase. The highest score is 360 points. If you pass the tunnel safely without hitting any tower, you can also get 20 points. The firing speed of the towers will double if you still stay in the tunnel after you've hit 10 towers.[CR]When a certain amount of towers are hit, the color of the ground will turn blue. (Originally, it's green.) During this period of time, you can get one extra UFO as bonus by hitting 10 more towers, either above ground or underground. The maximum number of UFOs you can gain is eight. The firing speed of the towers will become triple after you've gained all of your eight bonus points.[CR]~From the Manual[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Custer's Revenge</title_clean>
				<plot>Custer's Revenge is a pornographic video game made for the Atari 2600 by Mystique, a company that produced a number of adult video game titles for the system. The main character was based on General George Custer.[CR]The game was first released on October 13, 1982, and has received significant criticism because of its crude simulation of an apparent rape of a Native American woman. As a result, it has been credited as being one of the worst games ever made.[CR]Controversy:[CR]Custer's Revenge gained notoriety for its peculiar plot. The game prompted criticism from women's rights groups who stated that the game was a simulation of rape; the back of the packaging states "she's not about to take it lying down, by George! Help is on the way." Other groups such as Women Against Pornography, Native American spokespersons, and critics of the video game industry in general protested the game. Andrea Dworkin claimed the game "generated many gang rapes of Native American women."[CR]Aside from complaints over the game's sexual content, many found the gameplay simplistic. People also found the pornography element of the game inadequatethe two characters' appearances have been compared to Lego bricks or cardboard boxes.[CR]The focused media attention caused the game to sell approximately 80,000 copies, twice as many copies as Mystique's other X-rated games, Bachelor Party and Beat 'Em &amp; Eat 'Em.[CR]Variations:[CR]Like many other video game manufacturers of the early 1980s, Mystique went out of business. It sold the rights to its games to Playaround, which continued to market Custer's Revenge as Westward Ho for a time. Playaround made minor modifications to the game, which included making the skin of the "woman" darker and having her extend her arm and gesture to "Custer" to come over to her. It also made a version of the game called General Retreat. In this game it is the "woman" who has to overcome various obstacles to have sex with "Custer." Instead of arrows, cannon balls are fired at the woman.[CR]Due to the game's pornographic gameplay, this game was often banned from stores or hidden behind the sales counter and only could be bought after directly asking for the game and after presenting I.D.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custer%27s_Revenge[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You have been sent to deliver a message. Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.[CR]IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)[CR]You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.[CR]As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).[CR]After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.[CR]You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.[CR]Game variations[CR]After you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.[CR]The difficulty settings are:[CR]Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.[CR]Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.[CR]Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.[CR]The difficulty switches are not used.[CR]After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Readiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.[CR]Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.[CR]Destroy the left or right generator=2000 points[CR]Destroy the center generator=5000 points[CR]Shield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than zero.</plot>

				<title_clean>Defender II</title_clean>
				<plot>The player flies a small spaceship above a long, mountainous landscape. The land is inhabited by a small number of humanoids. The landscape wraps around, so flying constantly in one direction will eventually bring the player back to their starting point. The players ship can fly through the landscape without being destroyed.[CR]A number of enemy ships fly over the landscape. The player's responsibilities are twofold:[CR]1.Destroy all aliens[CR]2.Protect the humans from being captured[CR]The player is armed with a beam-like weapon which can be fired rapidly in a long horizontal line ahead of the spaceship, and also has a limited supply of smart bombs, which can destroy every enemy on the screen. The player also has a limited supply of "Inviso" cloaking energy, which makes the ship invisible, and able to destroy any ships it comes in contact with.[CR]At the top of the screen is a radar-like scanner, which displays the positions of all aliens and humans on the landscape.[CR]The Stargate:[CR]A central feature of the gamefield is the Stargate itself, represented by a series of concentric rectangles. The operation of the Stargate depends on the current game conditions.[CR]If a Lander is in the process of abducting a Humanoid, entering the Stargate will warp the ship to where the Humanoid is under attack.[CR]If the ship is carrying four humanoids simultaneously, entering the Stargate will jump ahead a number of levels, allowing more advanced players to skip the easier lower levels (and also get a great number of points reward, and the extra lives, smart bombs and inviso energy associated with it). This warp jump is no longer available after level 10.[CR]Otherwise, entering the Stargate will warp the ship to the opposite side of the planet.[CR]Inside Jokes:[CR]Stargate adds several new enemies to the lineup originally introduced in Defender. The names of most of the new creations are based on inside jokes.[CR]The original enemies are now known as "The Irata." Irata is the name of Williams competitor Atari spelled backwards. Essentially, the objective of the game is to destroy Atari before it can take over the planet.[CR]One of the other new enemies is also named after a competitor, "Yllabian Space Guppies." Bally was a major competitor with Williams in both the videogame and pinball markets.[CR]Another new enemy is the "Dynamo," which breaks into several small "Space Hums." This is in homage to the risque song Dinah-Moe Humm by Frank Zappa.[CR]Three new arrivals, "Phreds," "Big Reds," and "Munchies," vaguely resemble Pac-Man, a game released in the U.S. by Bally.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_II[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The dice puzzle has 16 squares of random numbers between 1-6. The object is to change all the numbers to 6 in the shortest amount of time, using the fewest numbers of turns.[CR]When the power is turned on, each square will have the number 1. After pushing the reset button, all the dice change to random numbers. (The game is guaranteed to be solvable every time.) There is a small square that moves outside of the left side and over the top by using the joystick. When the fire button is pushed, all the numbers in the row next to the square increase by one. The numbers can also be changed diagonally. Every 5 minutes a warning will sound, up to a maximum time limit of 60 minutes. When all the dice are changed to 6, the game will automatically end displaying time used and number of turns taken.[CR]The dice puzzle - sometimes mind boggling, sometimes a cinch, is always loads of fun. Come and match wits with the computer.[CR]~From the Manual[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Dig Dug</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]  View zoomed image in  gallery for animation.     You play as Dig Dug (who is also known as    Taizo Hori in other games that he appears in), a  pump wielding spelunker who faces several enemies while he digs    underground. The object of each level (or board) is to clear it of all of the enemies before they kill you by walking to within a set distance and pushing the button to fill the up with air until they explode. Another more strategic way to dispatch your enemies would be to dig underneath    boulders that are located on each level and drop them on to to enemies that are below them. It could be argued that this was one of the first major acts of  violence  in a video game, but due to it's cartoon like nature it was probably overlooked at the time. The original game was released into arcades by Namco in 1982, and contained the standard (at the time) of 256 levels before you reached a    "kill screen" and the game either froze up or  reset itself. Another source of scoring points throughout the game is the inclusion of a fruit or item in the center of the screen that would appear after dropping two of the levels boulders. This mechanic is very similar to another Namco game series,    Pac-Man. The boulders did not have to drop on enemies for the fruits to appear however. The bonus items include :    Carrot,  Turnip, Zucchini (or Cucumber),    Eggplant,  Green Pepper,    Tomato,    Garlic,    Watermelon,    Pineapple, as well as the inclusion of a  Warship from Namco's    Galaxian.     [CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]PookaPooka: Best described as a round orange ball with aviator goggles, Pooka is the most common enemy that you will  face in the game. Not as overly aggressive as his counter part, he as well as Fygar still has the ability to pass through  the un-dug parts of the dirt in each level to attack you from any angle.  FygarFygar: A dragon-like creature, not only can he pass through the dirt and attack you but also has the ability to breathe fire, making him a decidedly more difficult and deadly enemy.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Dig-Dug is considered to be a classic and has spawned many    sequels and has appeared on many    compilations and game download services since its initial release. The character of DIg-Dug also has a son named Susumu Hori ( that appears in the    Mr. Driller series), continuing the family legacy of digging to the depths of the earth.  Downloading and playing the demo of the XBLA version unlocks a Gamerpic. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Boy version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game scores of 6,6,6, and 5.  They stated, "...the game play is intact and the graphics are decent for GB standards.  A few new features [are] thrown in for a little variety and you have a solid little GB cart that's great for long road trips".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You've seen them do it at the circus, but can you keep the plates spinning on top of those tall skinny sticks? The action never Stops in this video version of the big top. Ali you have to do is keep running back and forth as you try to balance the plates that just never seem to stop coming. And, if you're lucky, when they all seem to come crashing down you'll be able to catch them. After this game doing the dinner dishes will seem like child's play. [CR]BALANCING THOSE PLATES [CR]To move the girl right or left, merely push the joystick controller right or left. If you see a plate that needs balancing, position the girl so that her arm is holding the pole, then hold down the action button on your joystick until the plate stops wobbling. [CR]If you need to catch a falling plate, just move the girl under it and let it touch her. It will automatically be replaced by another plate at the top of the pole. [CR]~From the Manual[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Dolphin</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dolphin is an Atari 2600 game by Matthew Hubbard where players control a dolphin swimming through the ocean in a side scrolling view. In an effort to escape a pursuing squid, players must listen to the sound effects from the game to determine where to swim. Walls of sea horses approach quickly, with very narrow gaps to swim through. The dolphins of the ocean squeak at the player to indicate where the gap is located, so the player can react in time. A high pitched tone means to swim high, and a low pitched ton means to swim low. With practice, it's a simple task to always know exactly where to swim in order to never lose speed. Each gap that is successfully passed without touching the sides earns a handful of points.In addition to swimming through gaps, the player can use the currents of the ocean (represented by arrows in the water) to their advantage. Swimming over arrows pointing in the correct direction offer a speed boost, while arrows pointing the other way will reduce the player's speed. However, the currents of the sea affect the squid too, so clever players will lure the squid into the low speed currents and away from the high speed currents.After a little while of swimming, the squid will eventually change colors, letting players know that they have gone up a level. The squid gets smarter as time goes on, and will start avoiding bad currents, making it harder to escape. Shortly after reaching the next level, a seagull will fly over the ocean. If the player can jump out of the water and catch the seagull, they will become temporarily invulnerable, granting the dolphin the power to defeat the mighty squid for a huge haul of bonus points.If the squid got too close, players could give him "the slip" as a last resort by quickly turning around and swimming the other way. This could create some very tense and exciting moments[CR]The "Friends of Dolphins" and "Secret Society of Dolphins"[CR]Like many Activision games of the era, patches would be awarded to players who achieved certain scores within the game. They asked for a photo of the player's TV to determine eligibility. There were two tiers of patches that would be awarded for Dolphin players.The first patch one could earn was the "Friends of Dolphins" patch. According to the game's manual, players would have to send a photo of a score of at least 80,000 in order to earn this patch.But for those who could go even further beyond, there was the "Secret Society of Dolphins." The manual did not say what score would have to be achieved in order to join these prestigious ranks (though they did promise that it was less than 500,000). Once the magic number was reached, the score on screen would be replaced by a secret password which would have to be shown in the photo players submitted, and would allow one entry into the ranks of the Secret Society of Dolphins.[CR]Atari 2600 Switches[CR]The game featured eight game modes which allowed the player to start the game with higher squid intelligence, or two player alternating modes. The difficulty switches change the amount of time the dolphin is invincible for after catching the seagull. On easy, it's four seconds. On Hard, it's only two. If the player is doing well and keeping their distance from the squid, two seconds is not enough to turn around and catch the squid before time is up, forcing players to deliberately slow down when the seagull is about to come.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa![CR]Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.[CR]Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.[CR]Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.[CR]In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.[CR]Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</plot>

				<plot>Dragster is a drag racing simulation for one or two players. The object of the game is to be the first car to race across the screen in the two player game, or to race across the screen in the shortest possible time in a one player game. The joystick acts as both the gas peddle and clutch; you have the ability to shift from first through fourth, but be careful not to shift too soon because you can't downshift! You must also be careful not to rev your engine too much, or you'll blow your engine and be out of the race. There are two game variations included; in the simpler game, you just need to drive straight to reach the goal. In the advanced variation, you also have the ability to steer and need to keep your car driving straight between the bleachers and road divider.</plot>

				<plot>Dune is an unreleased prototype based on the 1984 movie of the same name. It appears that it was to be an action/adventure style game similar to Atari's classic Adventure, but given as the game was never finished, we'll never know for sure. Dune was designed by Atari programmers Bruce Poehlman and Gary Stark, but it appears programming was began by another party. This prototype appears to be only about 30% complete--the game engine seems to be done, but many of the gameplay elements and graphics are missing. Presumably this title was canceled with the Tramiels shut down 2600 game development and fired most of the staff.[CR]http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=2682[CR]</plot>

If you miss any eggs, they will break and yolk starts collecting at the bottom of the screen. Miss too many, and the game will be over. At the end of each round you will be given an opportunity to earn bonus points; you now get to throw all of the eggs you caught back at the bird! As the levels progress, the games speed will increase. There are two difficulty levels available, in the easier variation you get a larger hat to catch the eggs with.</plot>

				<title_clean>Elevator Action</title_clean>
				<plot>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.[CR]Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:[CR]1. Shooting them with his gun.[CR]2. Kicking them by jumping onto them.[CR]3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.[CR]4. Crushing them with an elevator.[CR]Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.[CR]While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. [CR]Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.[CR]Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.[CR]If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</plot>

				<title_clean>Eli's Ladder</title_clean>
				<plot>This game was designed to help teach children addition, subtraction and counting. Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.[CR]The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.[CR]The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.[CR]There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.</plot>

				<title_clean>Elk Attack</title_clean>
				<plot>With a name like Elk Attack you'd probably expect a game involving herds of deadly rampaging elk right?  Well I hate disappoint you but there aren't herds of rampaging elk in this game, in fact this game has nothing to do with elks at all!  Elk Attack is really a port of the obscure Taito arcade game Electric Yo-Yo! Programmer Mark Hahn named the game Elk Attack as a joke, and probably would have changed the name had it been published.[CR]Silly name aside, Elk Attack is really a Pac-Man type game but without a maze.  You control a Yo-Yo type machine, which must use its string to latch onto and destroy all the colored blocks on the screen.  Along the way you'll encounter strange worm like creatures (sorry no elks), which will attempt to disrupt your Yo-Yo.  To help you fight the worms there are power squares scattered around the board which when grabbed will render your Yo-Yo temporarily invincible and increase your speed.   However unlike Pac-Man touching a worm while invincible will only net you points, and will not destroy of them.  Because of this its best to just go about your business and clear the maze instead of hunting down the worms.[CR]Since you use your string as your main means of propulsion, you must be careful as the screen becomes more and more open. For once you latch onto a block you can't let go until you touch it.  The most common way of dying is to accidentally latch onto a block on the other side of the screen and be sucked into a waiting enemy.  Clearing the board in a set pattern is the best way to avoid leaving large (and potentially dangerous) gaps between blocks.[CR]While it's not a bad game, Elk Attack lacks one very important feature found in its arcade counterpart.  In Electric Yo-Yo there is an indestructible enemy which roams the screen making your life miserable.  Since you can't use the power squares to stun this enemy you must carefully plan on how avoid him.  It's this missing feature that makes the difficulty level in Elk Attack too easy.  In fact it's possible for even an average player to go 10 or 20 levels without dying.  Even though the enemies speed up as the levels progress they don't become much of a factor with large number of power squares available, it's the indestructible enemy that really adds the challenge to the game.  Atari made the right decision in not pick up Elk Attack for release in its current form.  With a few added gameplay elements Elk Attack would have been sure fire hit and a darn good clone of Electric Yo-Yo.  But for one reason or another this never happened, and the game was left in its current state. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/elkattack/elkattack.htm[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Enduro</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR] Enduro, programmed by       Larry Miller and released by     Activision in 1983, is a racing game for the    Atari 2600 that challenged players to race through   day and night conditions as well as  weather changes.  Enduro would start you off each "day" with a specific number of cars you needed to pass in order to qualify you for the next day's race. The concept of changing weather patterns, such as snow and rain as well as a thick fog would drift in and out of the levels force you to handle your car in different ways. When fog came, you moved at a snails pace so not to cause car wrecks, when the weather would clear it would be pedal to the metal. Despite racing being  absolutely nothing like the sport of basketball,  Enduro is frequently suggested to  Game Room players who also enjoy  Double Dunk.[CR]Control [CR]The game focused on Atari 2600 joystick control and was therefore extremely simplistic by necessity. Left and right would move your car as such, while up and down would act as a change in speed. The real challenge was to not strike cars on any side as your car would slow to a stop and all the cars would pass by, leaving you to start over.[CR]</plot>

On hairpin turns to Tennessee, to the zero-visibility of a New England fog. And back. There is no finish line. Driver Qualifications: You never fear, never sleep. Your only goal in life is to break your own last record, rev that extra RPM, race that extra mile. Spend most of your time in fast lanes. Usually see competitors in your rear-view mirror. You are your own idol. The race is set. Are you?</plot>

				<plot>What started out as a nice little archaeological expedition has suddenly become a nightmarish fight for survival! A team of archaeologists is trapped in an underground maze of dark, winding tunnels. All around them, fearsome zombies are emerging from the crypts. The archaeologists' only hope of survival (apart from some very fast running) is an ancient device known as the 'make-break', which can be used to either create or destroy pieces of wall.[CR]In this increasingly frantic one or two-player arcade game, you'll need wits as well as dexterity. You'll have to think on the fly, plan strategically and race through the maze as fast as you can. Fail to keep up the pace and you're zombie fodder. Good luck!</plot>

				<title_clean>Fantastic Voyage</title_clean>
				<plot>Fantastic Voyage is a vertically scrolling shooter for one player. The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.</plot>

The game was developed by Rup Fulop, known for his Atari 2600 ports of Missile Command, Atlantis, and other classic titles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players control Proteus, who must rescue Neptina (Neptune's daughter) by taking the form of both a dolphin and a seagull.Players start the game as a dolphin, where they must submerge several screens, avoiding obstacles, and touching seahorses. Doing this helps locate the trident pieces, which are in different locations each level and playthrough.Players then assume the role of the seagull. Flying several screens horizontally reveals clouds and obstacles. The pink clouds are collected which become stars, also helping to locate the remaining trident pieces.After collecting the trident, players must again become the dolphin in order to rescue Neptune's daughter from her undersea cage. Once the game is complete, the player may continue playing at a higher difficulty.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Programmers credit[CR]Release the mermaid on Level 2 but swim up and leave before her cage is fully open. Transform into a seagull and fly to the letft or right of a volcano. The programmers' initials will form the volcanoes.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Programmers credit[CR]After releasing the mermaid the 7th time Imagic's address will appear at the bottom of the screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Health[CR]Whenever you switch from the dolphin to the seagull or vice versa, you will get an additional 10 points of health. So keep switching back and forth to get as much health as needed.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>A local warehouse has caught fire, and you're the fire fighter who has to come to the rescue! Your goal is to save the worker who is trapped in the warehouse; on the right side of the screen is a firetruck with an adjustable ladder. You can move the ladder to the appropriate floor of the building to climb up and rescue the trapped worker. Depending on which floors have caught fire, the worker will move to the lowest floor he can which isn't burning; you'll need to estimate which floor he'll be on when you position the ladder. Once the worker is safe, you move on to the next (more challenging) level. The fire in the building may spread quickly! If necessary, you can use a fire hose to put out the fire. Of course, you have a limited supply of water so make sure you don't run out! As the levels progress, the building becomes shorter and the fire spreads faster which means you don't have as much time in which to rescue the trapped victims.</plot>

				<plot>Test Pilot Log March 17, 2093: On what started to be the routine high speed test of interplanetary craft Delta 12, a powerplant malfunction caused the craft to skip off the rim of a small black hole. I found myself in a time and place unknown to me. The planet is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures. The inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical. A group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive at the expense of others in the society. After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds, these bugs began attacking the good creatures. The good bugs have asked for my help. I have been put in command of the best machine bug on their planet. My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the bad bugs have created creature machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.</plot>

				<title_clean>Fishing Derby</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Fishing Derby was programmed by David Crane and was one of Activision's original four games released for the Atari 2600 in 1980 (along with Boxing, Checkers, and Dragster).  The game is played using the standard Atari 2600 joystick controller.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]In Fishing Derby, two fishermen sit on opposing piers over the water.  The goal is to catch 99 pounds of fish first.  A single player may play against the AI opponent, or two players can compete against each other.  The joystick is used to maneuver the fisherman's line; upon hooking a fish, it is reeled in slowly.  Using the action button, the player can reel in the fish faster.  Only one fisherman may reel in a fish at a time.  If one player hooks a fish while his opponent has already, he must wait for his opponent to either catch or lose his hooked fish.  Bigger fish, which will contribute more to the player's score when caught, sit at the bottom of the water, while lighter fish swim near the surface.  Additionally, a shark roams the water and attempts to devour hooked fish.  [CR]Game Modes [CR]Game 1: Player vs. Computer Game 2: Player vs. Player[CR]Difficulty Switches[CR]The setting of the left switch affects the left player, while the right switch affects the right player. A: Fish must be hooked by positioning the bait under the fish's nose.B: Fish can be hooked by positioning the bait near the fish's mouth.[CR]</plot>

Shooting the generator will keep the Disrupter from moving about the city for a little bit but the debris never stops while you are within, so don't hang out in the Disrupter.[CR]If you destroy five warriors at one hatching pod or your ship is destroyed when it returns, you will have a shield for a short time. There will be two beeps to warn you of the shield leaving.[CR]The scoring is as follows:[CR]10 points = Debris[CR]25 points = Patrol Ship[CR]70 points = Rescued Spaceman[CR]100 points = Disrupter Generator[CR]You get 100 points for killing the first warrior at a pod, 200 for the second, 300 for the third and so on.[CR]You lose 1,000 points if you shoot a spaceman, but Flash Gordon would never do that, right?[CR]Every time you conquer a city, you get an extra man.</plot>

				<plot>Football is a football game for two players. The game is played from a top down point of view of the field and features two skill levels and three game variations. Using the joystick you can choose from one of five different offensive or defensive plays. In the first game variation, after selecting a play you then control the players on the field. In the second game, you have the option of controller your players after a play is selected or allowing the computer to control the players. The third game has the computer controlling the players at all times and you only need to select the plays you wish it to execute  and indicate when you wish to punt or pass the ball. In all of the game variations the timer begins at 5 minutes, and is active only during plays. Of course, the team with the most points when the timer runs out wins!</plot>

				<plot>Ah, you poor woodcutter. You just want to cut some wood to sell so your family can eat but an evil witch has put a spell on the animals so they are attacking you. Well, no matter, one way or another you'll get your tree![CR]You must make your way two screens to the right to get to your tree. Animals will come at you from either side of the screen. You must either jump over the animal or press your button and push the joystick in the desired direction to chop them with your axe. Snakes cannot be chopped, only jumped over. [CR]Also to contend with is a bird in the air that is dropping stones. If you are hit by a stone, you will be unable to move for two seconds, which could prove fatal. Once you reach the tree, you must chop it down while still avoiding the animals. It takes four chops per side to fell the tree. If you need to, you can climb the tree to avoid animals. Once the tree is chopped, the game restarts at a faster level. You have only one life so if an animal touches you, it is game over.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In the game the     chickens start on one side of the freeway with ten lanes between them and the other side of the street, with each lane containing cars moving at varying speeds. Once a chicken reaches the other side of the street the player controlling it scores a point and a new chicken appears at the start position. On difficulty A if the chicken is hit by a car it will be reset to the start position while on difficulty B if the chicken is hit by a car it will be pushed back two lanes. The game can be played either in single player or two player mode and in two player mode the winner of the game is the player who can get the most chickens to the other side of the street in two minutes.  If players could send    Activision a picture of them having scored 20 points on either the third or seventh level of the game, Activision would send them a 'Save The Chicken Foundation' patch featuring a picture of the chicken from the game. [CR]Development [CR]The game was created and programmed by   David Crane who conceived the idea for the game during the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, while watching a man trying to cross Lake Shore Drive on foot. The original version of the game was called Bloody Human Freeway and featured a man crossing a street who would leave a bloody streak behind when hit by cars, however the change to the version of Freeway which was released was made after complaints from some employees within Activision. It was one of the first independent games published by Activision on the  Atari 2600.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Freeway - Das verrueckte Huhn</title_clean>
				<plot>This game is not as 'simple' as it looks! Select any one of eight traffic patterns inspired by the most treacherous traffic you'll ever encounter on the nation's highways. Traffic flow varies from a few slow-moving autos to frantic rush hour intensity, complete with blaring horns and roaring engines - everything except exhaust! Test your agility, cunning and courage by helping your 'daredevil chicken' across the freeway. You get a point for each crossing, but you'll need quick reflexes and great timing to make it across without getting hit. Freeway by Activision is unlike any video game you've ever seen. It's fast, tricky and traffic-jammed with fun!</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Frogger is a top-down, multi-stage action game. The player controls frogs home, while avoiding obstacles. The arcade game's popularity lead to many ports, remakes, and sequels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Frogger about to cross the road.  [CR]The objective in Frogger is controlling frogs home using a four-way joystick. Gameplay is timed, and successful completion requires navigating several contiguous stages in each level.[CR]First, the frog must cross a highway while avoiding various automobiles. Lanes of traffic operate in alternating directions, and at different speeds. Getting squashed by a vehicle causes the player to lose one life, and restart the level.[CR]A median separates the highway from a river. In later stages, the median is occupied by a snake which will also cause the player to lose a life if touched. The river contains alternating lanes of turtles and logs, moving in alternate directions, and at different speeds. The turtles move in groups of two or three, and every other group submerges regularly. The player must navigate over the turtles while above water to reach logs in various configurations, and repeat the process until reaching home.[CR]Timing is critical as the player navigates the frog into one of five home slots. Missing the slot, or reaching the edge of the screen before leaping home loses the player one life, and restarts the stage. Once a home slot is filled, the stage restarts, and play resumes until all home slots are filled, causing the next level to start.[CR]Score is kept as each frog progresses toward home, points are tallied. Additionally, optional bonus points are gained by rescuing a lady frog atop a log by hopping over her, and bringing her into a home slot without dying. Further bonus points are earned through catching briefly-appearing flies in home slots, and finishing stages early.[CR]Later stages present the player with additional challenges from faster moving obstacles, faster submersing turtles, alligators occupying home slots briefly, snakes moving along logs, and trickier log configurations.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The popular 1990s show Seinfeld had an episode almost entirely dedicated to Frogger. In the episode George Costanza learns that a pizza place he visited frequently as a child is closing down which will lead to the unplugging of a Frogger arcade machine and the loss of his high score. At the end of the episode, from a top down view identical to the game, we see George maneuver the arcade cabinet through traffic to reach the other side of the street.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Frogger II - Threeedeep!</title_clean>
				<plot>In Frogger II, you need to guide your frog to safety in three different locations. Starting out underwater, reach the top of the pond while avoiding dangerous alligators and fish (you can ride a turtle for safety!). Once on top of the pond, hop across logs, birds, and even a whale to the life preserver trailing behind a tugboat. In the third location you have to hop across a flock of birds to reach a cloud at the top of the screen. Each frog has a time limit to safely reach one of the homes on each of the three screens. You move on to the next level when a frog has safely reached each of the homes on all screens.</plot>

				<title_clean>Frogs and Flies</title_clean>
				<plot>In this game, the player or players control a frog sitting on a lily pad. One frog is green and the other frog is red. The game can be played either by one or two players. The object of the game is to eat the most flies.[CR]Each game starts out in the morning with a light blue sky. If there is not a second player, the system will automatically take control of the red frog within a few seconds. Each frog jumps from one lily pad to the other. During each hop, a number of flies fly around the screen. The player pushes the fire button, which causes the frog's tongue to stick out. If the frog is in the right spot ahead or behind a fly, it catches and eats the fly. Each time a fly is captured it is worth two points. The game progresses throughout the day, with the sky turning a darker shade of blue, and eventually turning black as the day ends. About a minute after the sky turns black, the two frogs leave the screen - the green frog exits to the left, and the red frog to the right. A firefly then comes on to the screen carrying a "The End" message, which it leaves in the center of the screen. The frog who has captured the most flies at that point is the winner.[CR]There are two different levels to Frogs and Flies that players can select. On the first level, the jumping off and landing points are fixed, the user needs to time their jumps to catch any flies who may come into the frog's flight path. On the second level, the frogs are free to move about the ground to catch flies as the jumping and landing points are not fixed. A player can even cause a frog to jump into the water - in that case, the frog will swim back on to the nearest pad. Generally this is to be avoided since it takes several seconds for the frog to swim back to the pad.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogs_and_Flies[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Front Line</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Front Line is a vertical-scrolling run and gun from Taito in which the player controls a single soldier sent against an entire army. The player can shoot in eight directions, as can most of the enemies, and some amount of cautious advancement is required in order to survive to the end of the level, after which the player will rescue a POW and move onto the next level.[CR]The game is historically significant as being the first vertical-scrolling run and gun. Future games of this format that would go on to receive a lot more critical acclaim and attention from gamers include Commando, Ikari Warriors and Guerrilla War. Ikari Warriors, especially, borrowed a lot from Front Line, including being able to drive tanks and having to leave said tanks before they explode after they receive too much damage.[CR]It was the fourth of Taito's Arcade conversions for the Nintendo Famicom, after Space Invaders, Chack'n Pop and Elevator Action.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You are the Funky Fish. The object of the game, here, is to attack the sea creatures who are guarding the monster. You shoot them with your bubbles and they turn into fruit. You must then eat the fruit to maintain energy. If you take to long getting the fruit, it will turn back into the sea creature it was before and continue to chase you. If you are touched by a sea creature or you touch the monster, you lose a life and become bones, sinking to the sea bottom. If you lose all your lives, the game is over.</plot>

				<title_clean>G.I. Joe - Cobra Strike</title_clean>
				<plot>Cobra Strike is an arcade style action game for one to three players. As G.I. Joe, you need to defend the recruits at a training camp from the evil Cobra, who is attacking the camp in the form of a giant snake. You control a shield and a gun; as the recruits run along the bottom of the screen towards safety, you need to use the shield to block the deadly venom and laser beams coming from the snake. When you get a chance, you can use the gun to shoot the snake. Hit the snake with eight direct hits and it will be destroyed and you can move on to the next level. If the snake manages to kill four of your recruits, the game is over. In the two player version of the game, both players can play cooperatively and try to destroy the snake together, or one player can control the snake and one protect the recruits. In the three player version, two players protect the recruits while the third player controls the snake.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] See the Programmer Credits[CR]Choose a two-player cooperative game, along with the first difficulty setting. Find and hit the 15th COBRA member eight times. When you do that, the programmer's credits, ''JE'' will come up.</plot>

				<plot>S.B.I. (Spectravision Bureau of Investigation) file on Chicago Joe and his gang:[CR]We apprehended Chicago Joe but in retaliation, his gang have holed up in an apartment building, taking hostage a dame and her kid. The following men have been positively identified:[CR]Shifty[CR]2. Scar Face[CR]3. Mugsy[CR]4. Lefty[CR]5. Nitro Ed[CR]Your orders are to snipe any gang member. DO NOT SHOOT AN INNOCENT! Watch out for Nitro Ed. He likes to play with hand grenades. One of those and you're pushing up daisies. Good luck.[CR]You move the joystick to aim at a gangster and push the button to fire. Your ammo is limited so don't fire randomly. Occasionally, Nitro Ed, on the roof, will hold up a grenade. You must shoot him to disarm him. You get money for each gangster shot. The values for level one are:[CR]1. Mugsy=$20[CR]2. Scare Face=$30[CR]3. Lefty=$40[CR]4. Shifty=$50[CR]5. Disarming Nitro Ed=$100[CR]These amounts increase for each level by $10.  You also get $10 for each bullet you have left after each level. There are six levels. The fourth level is a nighttime level. In this level, you must fire one bullet to light up the windows. If you do not fire for a couple seconds, they go dark again.[CR]If you shoot an innocent, you will lose $1000 or you total amount if you have less than $1000.[CR]If a gangster rises all the way out of a window, after a couple of seconds, he will shoot you and you will lose one bullet proof vest (life). After you lose all your vests, the game is over and Nitro Ed will laugh at you. If Nitro Ed gets off his hand grenade, no matter how many vests you have, the game is over. And Nitro Ed will laugh at you. You start with four vests and can earn another at $5000.</plot>

				<title_clean>Garfield</title_clean>
				<plot>1984 wasn't a good year for Atari or the video game industry in general.  In fact Atari was doing so poorly it was losing almost a million dollars a day!  Because of this Atari decided to stop developing games that it didn't think would sell in large numbers.  Once Atari was sold to the Tramiels they took a look at Garfield and decided they didn't want to pay the high royalties to Jim Davis and Steve Woita, so the game was canceled.  When Steve heard this he didn't take the news very well, but he had little time to protest as most of Atari's staff was laid off.  To make a long story short, Garfield was never finished.[CR]While Atari may have thought Garfield had limited appeal, its obvious they didn't take the time to play the game.  Had they actually taken a close look at Garfield they would have discovered that while it may feature a well-known cartoon cat, it was actually a great side scrolling platform game (something the 2600 library was sorely lacking).  Even in its unfinished state, Garfield proves that the 2600 could do a multi-screened side scrolling game (and all this after only 2 months of programming!).  Too bad Atari didn't agree.[CR]As you probably guessed, Garfield stars the lovable orange furball from the Sunday comics (no not Alf!).  Garfield is on a mission to find Nermal (wasn't he always trying to get AWAY from Nermal?), and to accomplish this mission he's going to have to cross five different action filled screens while keeping a looking out for the nefarious Odie!  The movement in Garfield is a bit strange, you don't move left or right with the joystick but by pressing the fire button to jump.  It takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but fits in well with the whole fence post idea.[CR]According to Steve Garfield still needed about 2 to 3 months of work before it would be complete.  The final game was to have hundreds of screens and probably would have been the largest 2600 game to date (certainly one of the most ambitious in any case).  Garfield finally turned up when Jim Davis finally gave Steve permission to distribute the rom.  It's great to see large companies (in this case Paws inc.) finally give permission for ancient (but still copyrighted) games to be released so the public can enjoy them.  Now if only other companies would follow suit (Pink Panther anyone?). [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/garfield/garfield.htm[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You are in your vehicle which has terrible fuel efficiency. A real gas hog. You are trying to travel along but there is one or more ships above you that are trying to bomb you. To make things worse, there are holes in the road and other ships you need to shoot so as to not ram them.[CR]As you go along, you can accelerate or decelerate to avoid being bombed but be careful because you might ram some ships near the ground. You can jump to avoid them or blast them for points. You will also see numbers along your way. Run into them to acquire their point value. Do not shoot them or their value will be deducted from you score.[CR]As this is Gas Hog, you will soon run low on fuel. You must get below ground via the occasional holes, to grab a refuel marker. Do not stay below ground, however, as you travel in the wrong direction while there. You start with four lives and lose one if you are hit by a bomb or ship or run out of fuel.</plot>

				<plot>Your friend is trapped inside Ghost Manor! There are five different screens you need to get past before you can rescue your friend from the top floor of the manor. The game begins in the graveyard outside the manor; here you play tag with a friendly rainbow ghost or skeleton which will supply you with spears you can fire at enemies. In the second screen, you approach the guarded entrance of the manor. Using the spears you collected, you need to shoot all of the enemies blocking the entrance. The third and fourth screens take place inside the manor; each floor has a set of stairs as well as several treasures and crosses which can be collected. There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Ecto 1[CR]Ghostbusters was designed by David Crane and originally released by Activision in 1984. In the game, players start out by using their limited funds to purchase one of four vehicles, along with additional equipment necessary to catch ghosts. Players then move a Ghostbusters symbol around a map screen, plotting routes to ghost disturbances. At each disturbance, the player controls two Ghostbusters, attempting to use their proton beams to manuever the ghost over the trap they have placed and then catch the ghost. (Notably, only three Ghostbusters are ever depicted in the game, although there are four in the film.) If the player is successful in catching a ghost in the Commodore version, a voice declares "Ghostbusters!" If the player fails to do so, the ghost will slime the player, and a voice will say "He slimed me." All the while, the music consists of a rendition of the Ray Parker, Jr. hit "Ghostbusters" playing repeatedly.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]When the psychokinetic energy in the city reaches a certain level, provided that players have successfully earned some money, the game moves on to the next stage, in which players must sneak past the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man at the Temple of Zuul. In the original computer version, successfully getting two Ghostbusters past Stay-Puft resulted in the player winning the game. (Whether players win or lose, they are provided with an account number they can use to carry their earnings over to their next game, allowing them to purchase better equipment.)[CR]Later versions of the game included additional content. In the Sega Master System version, for instance, slipping past the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man was much easier than in the original computer versions. However, players then had to make their way up the stairs of the haunted apartment building, fending off plate-throwing ghosts, and then defeat Gozer in a brief shoot-out. The NES version had a similar sequence on the staircase, but it was far more difficult due to the odd controls.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Glacier Patrol takes place at the North Pole, where aliens are attempting to mount an invasion of Earth. A single alien spaceship moves back and forth at the top of the screen slowly dropping blocks of ice onto the ground below, attempting to build a wall. The player controls a character at the bottom of the screen armed with a ray gun, which is used to melt the blocks of ice before they hit the ground. The player must also jump over snowballs that randomly roll across the bottom of the screen. If the wall is completed by the aliens, the player loses. If the player is able to score 10,000 points before the wall is built, the sun rises and the ice melts.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Golf features a nine hole, par 36 course which can be played by one or two players. The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.</plot>

				<title_clean>Gorf</title_clean>
				<plot>Gorf is a game similar to Space Invaders, alien vessels approach closer and closer in their threatening row formation.[CR]The game itself consists of four levels:[CR]1. The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship &amp; shield on one side and the aliens on the other side;[CR]The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;[CR]The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading "towards" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;[CR]The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.[CR]Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.</plot>

				<plot>In the space shooter, you move your ship by moving the joystick in the direction you want to go. You fire by holding down the button and moving the joystick in the direction you want to shoot. You can shoot from the front of your ship, from the back or from either side.[CR]As you move forward, you can increase to four speeds. You must avoid or shoot the meteorites, shoot the aliens (but be warned: they shoot back), and always run from the super alien.[CR]On the screen, at the top is your score, just below that is the short range scanner. This shows you, the aliens, the meteorites and, if you run into it, the super alien. On the bottom left is the remaining ships (lives) On the bottom right is the velocity indicator. On the bottom center is the long range scanner. This shows you, the aliens and the super alien, but not the meteorites.[CR]As the super alien approaches, there will be an alarm sound. If the super alien catches you, you will be unable to move or fire and will lose a life. The game ends is you lose all your lives or get 999,999 points.</plot>

				<plot>This game is based on the Steven Spielberg movie of the same name but is different than the other versions.[CR]In this version, on the first screen, Mogwai are jumping from the roof to get at hamburgers on the ground. You, as Billy, must catch them before the hit the ground. If you get them all, it is off to the next, faster, level. If you miss eight, then you go to a shooting screen.[CR]On the shooting screen, gremlins are approaching from the distance. You must shoot them before they reach you. If one reaches you, you lose a life. After they are all dead, it is back to the first screen at a faster level. In later levels, puddles of water will divide the gremlins in two.</plot>

				<plot>Guardian is an arcade action game for one or two players. In an intergalactic war, an enemy ship called Dromeda is attacking your home planets and you need to defend them! The planets are located at either the top or the bottom of the screen, and are defended by a shield. Dromeda is in the middle of the screen, and will be launching explosive devices at the planets. You control a spaceship which is the last hope to save the planets. Unfortunately, your ships lasers are unable to reach Dromeda, so you you must shoot the explosives as they come in. If you miss any explosives, they will destroy part of the shield. If a large enough hole forms, an explosive could get through and destroy an entire planet. The game ends when all of your planets have been destroyed.</plot>

				<title_clean>Gyruss</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gyruss is a 1983 shoot 'em up created by Yoshiki Okamoto and Konami in which players take command of a ship trying to warp to Earth. Along the way, enemy spaceships, lasers, and meteors will appear and must be destroyed before the player can advance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Upon starting the game, players will be greeted with the message "2 WARPS TO NEPTUNE". Each level means the player is one warp closer to reaching the planet. Killing all enemies that appear in the level will complete the warp. The opposing spaceships will fly towards the player's ship in a pattern, often curving around the tube perspective and flying back towards the center, where they will wait. Enemy ships who are not shot while waiting in the center will fly off screen and reappear flying out from the center. Completing all the warps will display a quick cutscene of the player ship zooming towards Neptune. Next, a small bonus round called the Change Stage will start. The ships in the Chance Stage will not shoot back, allowing the player to rack up points with ease.[CR]In the arcade version of Gyruss, gameplay remains the same as the player warps from Neptune to Uranus, then Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and eventually Earth. The final level, "3 WARPS TO NEPTUNE", is extremely fast. Completing it restarts the game over at two warps to Neptune.[CR]In the NES version, the player starts at the edge of the Solar System, then warps to Neptune, Pluto, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury, and finishes the game at The Sun.PerspectiveThe ship sprites will shrink as they move farther down the 'tube'[CR]The most unique feature of Gyruss is the perspective: the field of play is a similar to a giant abstract tube with the player's ship flying through. Enemies will most often appear at the center of the 'tube' and fly outward to give the effect of rapid approach. On occasion, 'flocks' of enemy ships will fly out from the left or right side of the screen, breaking the tube perspective.Ports[CR]Gyruss proved to be a bit of a success for Konami, and ports were soon made for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, ColecoVision, Atari 8-bit, and Commodore 64. A port to the European ZX Spectrum was also planned, but later scrapped. In 2007, an Xbox Live Arcade port of Gyruss was released with updated sound and graphics. Gyruss has found its way onto several Konami compilations, such as the Playstation Konami Arcade Classics and Konami Collector's Series: Arcade Advanced for the Game Boy Advance. Gyruss is said to be coming to Microsoft's Game Room for the Xbox 360 and PC in July 2010.Differences between the NES remake and the Arcade version[CR]In 1988, Konami released Gyruss to The Famicom Disk System/ Nintendo Entertainment System under the Ultra Games label. This version was much more of a remake than a mere port. Along with a slight hint of story came improved art, new music, boss battles, more planets to warp to, added Chance Stages, and different power ups. A major difference in the story was that it featured Genghis Khan as a villain.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Excerpt from the Atari 5200 Gyruss manual -[CR]Within each warp you'll face FOUR different formations of enemy planes. The formations might emerge from the center of the screen where the planes band together--or form off screen where they can create a surprise attack. In either case, shoot down as many planes within the formation as you can and don't let them hit your own ship. Planes fire missiles, too...your only option is to avoid them...or be shot down. After the last formation appears, all the planes NOT shot down will regroup in the center and attack again. They will continue to do so until you've eliminated the last one--unless, of course, one eliminates you first.[CR]BUT PLANES ARE NOT ALL YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT. THERE ARE SWIRLING AND DEADLY SATELLITES AND METEORS, TOO.[CR]There are several reoccurring types of enemies in Gyruss: enemy ships, asteroids, satellites, and laser generators.[CR]Enemy ships will fly in formation from either the center (giving the illusion of depth) or from the left and right side of the screen. They will then head back to the center of the screen, growing smaller in size as they get away from the player ship. Ships in the middle of the screen can still be shot at, and neglecting to do so will cause the enemy ship to fly away and reappear later.[CR]Asteroids are round, blue blobs that start in the middle of the screen and suddenly zoom past the player. Asteroids will never change position in the 'tube' and are easily avoided.[CR]Satellites will phase into view usually right in front of the player ship and follow it around for a time. The satellites include three sections, the blue triangles, and the spiky orange middle. Shooting the orange spiky ball in the middle will double the player's firepower.[CR]The final type of enemy in the arcade version of Gyruss are the laser generators. Each generator consists of two small blue circles with yellow energy pulsing between them. Similar to asteroids, lasers will never change position and moving out of the way is the simplest way of combating them. Another way to stop the threat of laser generators is to shoot one of the two small blue circles holding the laser beam in place. This will stop the beam from pulsing and destroy the circle the player shot at, but the other half will remain on the screen and fly past like an asteroid.[CR]Like many old arcade games, all enemies are on a set pattern and basic memorization is key for high scores.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Gryuss makes a brief cameo in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.As with many Konami games, the Konami Code can be entered into the title screen of the NES remake, albeit backwards (A B A B right left right left down down up up).The main theme of Gyruss is a contemporary arrangement of Johan Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.An even more fast-paced and electronic arrangement of the Gyruss theme can be found in Konami's Dance Dance Revolution: ULTRAMIX 2 under the name GYRUSS -FULL TILT-.According to TwinGalaxies, the highest score ever recorded for the arcade version of Gyruss was Michael Bangs's perfect score of 47,024,400.Gyruss creator Yoshiki Okamoto was fired after the release of the game due to financial disputes. He then joined Capcom where he would later produce 1942 and Street Fighter II.After making Gyruss, Yoshiki Okamoto created another classic shoot 'em up, Time Pilot.The Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 ports of Gyruss were released by Parker Brothers.According to an article in Electronic Gaming Monthly, a lifeform from the planet Gyruss is known as a Gyrussian.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>H.E.R.O.</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]  H.E.R.O. is a platforming game published and developed by                     Activision in 1984. It was originally developed for the                    Atari 2600 but ported to many other consoles already listed on this page. The name is speculated to mean "Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   The main objective of the game is to rescue trapped miners. You're equipped with a       heli-pack  allowing you to          fly around the level, as well as a               laser-beam to defend yourself from the game's various enemies (             bats,             snakes,            spiders, etc). You're also equipped with           dynamite, which you can use to kill  enemies or to destroy various walls blocking your way. It's possible to use your laser beam to disintegrate the wall as well without the risk of killing yourself, although it takes longer. There are      magma walls later in the game that kill you if you touch them, making it slightly harder to plant dynamite next to, or navigate through the caverns. When you die, you're returned to the same screen as the one you were just on, costing a life. There is a        power meter on the bottom of the screen that slowly drains indicating a time limit, making later levels fairly difficult due to their length. When the power meter is drained, you lose a life. Later levels often feature a raft the player can use to float across the water unharmed.  [CR]H.E.R.O. for Xbox 360 Game Room[CR]H.E.R.O. was included in the June 23rd, 2010 Game Pack release of   Game Room for the  Xbox 360.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Halloween</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR]The game Halloween is based of the popular horror film of the same  name. You play as the babysitter trying to rescue the little children  from the serial killer Michael Myers who comes at you as well as the  children and chases you through a house with his knife. When he appears on screen you hear a Atari  rendition of the Halloween theme. If he comes within physical contact of the player or one of the children, their head disappears leaving blood spurting out while the decapitated person runs around the room in shock. An interesting fact is that when Wizard Video Games was getting rid of their inventory, they just placed duct tape over the top of the game cartridge and written on it was "Halloween" to cut printing costs. The tittle was written in orange sharpie, to try and add to the 'spookiness' of the game. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>Hangman is an electronic version of the game hangman! Your goal is to figure out a word that the computer has generated by guessing one letter at a time. Guess a correct letter, and it will appear on the screen in the proper location, but if you guess a letter that isn't in the word then you are one step closer to being hung. Guess eleven incorrect letters, and the game is over. A point is earned each time a word is completed. Several difficulty settings are included which affect the number of letters in the words. The game can be played by one or two players, and in the two player version the words can optionally be created by one of the players instead of the computer.</plot>

				<title_clean>Harem</title_clean>
				<plot>Let's face it, pornographic games aren't generally known for their plot.  Usually there's a flimsy excuse for a character to have sex with multiple women with a bit of danger thrown in for good measure, but that's about all.  That being said, usually the plots make some sort of sense (albiet a bit simplistic or contrived).  The same can't be said about Harem, which may just be the most surreal pornographic game to ever grace the 2600. [CR]What do mystery snipers, dragons, and gargoyles all have in common?  If you said elements of a good porno game, then you're probably smoking the same stuff that the developer of this game was.  Yes, you read that right.  Your character must contend with snipers, dragons, poisonous snake women, and gargoyles all in an attempt to get laid.  Surely there must be an easier way? [CR]Your character starts at the lower left of a multi-tiered screen and must make his way to the beautiful(?) woman to the right, however you'll soon find out that someone is out to stop your stud monkey conquests at all costs.  The first obstacle you'll encounter takes the form of a sniper hiding in a bush.  Why would a sniper be hiding in a bush just to shoot you in the buttocks?  Why not?  As you approach the bush a bullet will fly out in your direction, killing you if it makes contact.  To get past the sniper, simply run away a few times until he has to reload (the bullets will stop) and then run past the bush.  Once you're past the bush, you can run into your lady's loving arms and explore a different kind of bush?[CR]Each time you make it to one of the women, you will start the "humping" mini-game.  Your goal here is to meet her thrusts by pushing right every time she thrusts her pelvis.  If you're successful in your timing you will score a point and a tone will sound.  Each time you score a point, the tone will get higher and higher indicating that danger is approaching.  If you continue to "score" past a certain point (around 8 or so points) your woman will appear to explode and you will fall into a pit and die (I guess you were a little too much for her).  To avoid this, make sure you push the button to escape before this happens.  If you manage to score 69 points you will earn an extra life.[CR]The next obstacle you must face comes in the form of a river.  While conceptually this is the easiest obstacle to clear, the iffy collision detection makes it much more difficult than it should be.  To clear the river, simply run towards to it and push the button when your back foot is on the edge of the bank (not your front foot).  Assuming you timed it right, you will go flying over the river and meet yet another woman.  You know what to do?[CR]After you've scored as many points as you dare, you will be taken to the next area of the screen.  Here you must run past a dangerous fire breathing dragon, which is much more difficult than it sounds.  The trick to getting past the dragon is to wait for it to breathe fire, then quickly run by him.  Once you're past the dragon you'll undoubtedly notice the large pit ahead of you.  Here you must wait for the snake to change into a woman and then quickly drop down into the pit to "do the deed".  The timing on this is rather tricky as you can't simply wait around for the snake to change because the dragon is chasing you.  If you manage to time it just right and find the woman, you'll be taken to the last area of the game.[CR]In this final area you must chase down the woman running around the top of the castle as they aren't just going to wait around for you anymore.  As you chase your dream date, you'll notice that ugly little faces appear to be puking on you.  These are actually gargoyles, and they're trying to dump lava on you.  The gargoyles are easily avoided by stopping when they breathe fire, and since there are no other dangers on this level, you're free to stop and start the pursuit at will.  Each time you catch the woman you can score a few points in the standard manner, but she'll run away again and the chase continues?[CR]For a porno game, Harem is actually pretty good.  The gameplay is varied, and the graphics are respectable.  However the gameplay is rather difficult at times, and needs a bit of polish here and there.  The other main problem with Harem is that the game gets old after only a short time.  The thrill of being able to hump your lady can only entertain for so long, and once that bit of fun is gone the frustrating obstacles start to become more and more annoying than fun.  Still, Harem is much more refined than the schlock that companies like Playaround were putting out around the same time.  So if you're horny and the 2600 is the only game system you own, give Harem a try.  You might actually find yourself having a good time...

You must score at least three hundred points by the time the mole count reaches zero. If you reach or exceed three hundred points in one round, any points beyond three hundred will be added to your score as a bonus. If you fail to score three hundred points in one round, the game is over.</plot>

If there are other runners on base, a putout can be made by tagging any runner or, if the runner is in a "force play", by touching the base in front of that runner. With practice, doubleplays (two outs on one pitched ball) can be made with ease.[CR]~From the Manual[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] Modes[CR]This is the first baseball game for the home consoles that have more than just one mode. There are a total of 8 modes; each mode changes the number of fielders you have in the game. This game only supports single games.Mode 1 - Single FielderMode 2 - Two FieldersMode 3 - Three FieldersMode 4 - Three Fielders spread out[CR]Mode 5 through 8 are two player modes 1 through 4.[CR]Sound[CR]This game adheres to the grand Atari 2600 tradition of using computer beeps as sound. There are slightly different pitches to the beep but that is pretty minor. When the players move, the beep is used for each foot; each step the player takes. This might be the first baseball to attempt to do sound for the player movement, but I might prefer the silent smooth animation of the Astrocade baseball game to a beeping flickering animation of my player in Atari&#8217;s Home Run. There is no overall background sound or intro sound. There is also no sound effect when the inning ends or when the game is over.[CR]Rules of Baseball vs video game rules[CR]Home Run fails to put nine players on the field. It does play nine innings and batter&#8217;s count is correct. It even adheres to the rule of if batter is hit by pitch a free base is taken. When involved in a rundown the fielder only needs to touch the base for the force out or tag the player. This is a new element of the rules they nicly managed to include. The one aspect that is missing is the ability to throw the ball to base for the force out. It is missing because you only have one fielder and no other person to throw the ball to. You are able to perform a double play and I see no reason why a triple play cannot be preformed but chances of you managing to pull that off are very rare; only slightly more rare then witnessing a triple play in actual baseball.[CR]Video Game Innovations[CR]One player mode,can play against the CPUAbility to control a fielder after catching the ballFielder can perform a rundown and tag base runners outBaseball played with home plate near top of the screen and outfield towards the bottomSound effect for fielder movementsBaseball hats on players, first step in rendering baseball uniforms[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Human Cannonball</title_clean>
				<plot>In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land in a bucket of water. To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.</plot>

				<plot>Hunt &amp; Score is similar to the game Memory. The player is presented with a numbered grid; behind each grid section is a picture. On each turn, the player chooses two grid sections in an attempt to find two matching pictures. Points are earned for finding matching pictures, and the player with the most points at the end wins. Several game options include a 16 or 30 square game grid, the ability to handicap one of the players, and the ability to enable or disable wild cards.</plot>

				<plot>Ice Hockey is an ice hockey game for one player against the computer or two players. Each team consists of two players, one offensive and one defensive. At any given time one player is active and can be controlled while the other remains inactive; if the puck is near your goal then the defensive player becomes active, otherwise you control the offensive player. Each player has the ability to shoot the puck at a variety of angles, and can even body check their opponent! The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player more of an advantage.</plot>

				<title_clean>Ikari Warriors</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ikari Warriors, first released in 1986, was SNK's first true arcade classic in the United States. Ikari Warriors unique controls and multiplayer mode set it apart from other games, such as Commando. In Ikari Warriors, the players controls Ralf Jones and Clark Steel, two characters who later joined the King of Fighters roster. Players take control of Ralf and Clark, and fight through enemy units to try and save the village of Ikari.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ikari Warriors can be played single-player or two-player co-op. The game is seen from a top-down perspective, with players seeing the top of character's heads. The players are on the bottom of the screen, and advance upwards, while fighting through hordes of enemies. Players must be aware of how much ammunition they have, as it is limited. Tanks, which have armor that prevents our heroes from taking damage, can be commandeered throughout the game. However, they will eventually be destroyed by enemy fire.[CR]The original arcade version of Ikari Warriors allows players to move in one direction while firing in another. This is accomplished via a rotating joystick that allows players to aim in any of the eight movement directions. This style of gameplay made Ikari Warriors tough to duplicate in the numerous ports and remakes of the game that appeared on home consoles, with some, like the NES version, ignoring the feature completely and only allowing players to fire in the direction they're facing.[CR]Clark and Ralf were required to move quickly in the game. If they loitered for too long, red spots, or tracking fire, would appear below them to get them on the move. Also when playing co-op if one player moved faster than another the slower player could become stuck and would die as a result.[CR]Home Ports[CR]The home versions of the game often departed from the level design of the arcade game, with the NES version specifically getting a much longer game with more variety than the arcade version. However, much of this new material was of a lower quality than the arcade game. The NES version of the game also has one of the most notoriously easy codes in the history of the system, which allows you to continue from where you left off by pressing A, B, B, A after your last life is lost. The NES version also had a few bugs, like one co-op issue where a player would get dragged through some impassable object by the way the screen scrolls. After passing through the object, the player would be invincilbe to enemy fire, but invisible walls would often make forward progress tricky or even impossible.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Indy 500 is a driving game for the Atari VCS, developed by Atari. The retail game included Atari's special driving controllers and has 14 different game variations. The game launched with the system in 1977.[CR]Game variations[CR]Race Car (4 variants)The "Grand Prix" track.Players race on two different tracks named "Grand Prix"  and "Devil's Elbow" in either a 2-player competitive mode, or a single-player time-trial mode. In the time-trial modes, the player must complete as many laps as possible in 60 seconds.Crash 'n' Score (4 variants)This mode can be played on one of two different tracks and in single- and multiplayer mode. In multiplayer Crash 'n' Score, a white block will appear in a random spot on the field. The first player to run over the block will score a point; the block will then move to a new location, until one player has scored 50 points. In the single-player variants, the player must score as many points (or hits) as possible in 60 seconds.Tag (2 variants)Much like in the game of Tag, one car is "it." The car that is not "it" must avoid the car that is to prevent becoming "it." The player who isn't "it" will score one point every second they stay that way, until one player reaches 99 points, or 99 seconds of being not "it." Tag can be played on one of two different maps.Ice Race (4 variants)The Ice Race variants are remakes of the first four Race Car game variants. However, all the tracks are covered in ice, making handling the cars trickier.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Ixion</title_clean>
				<plot>Here's an oddity, an unreleased 2600 game that's a port of an unreleased game (an unreleased 8-bit port exists as well).  It appears that although Sega developed Ixion for multiple platforms, they never released it for anything. For those who don't know, Ixion was a character from Greek mythology.  Ixion was the son the Phlegyas, descendent of Ares, and king of the Lapiths in Thessaly.  He is also the first mortal to shed kindred blood.  To punish him, Zeus bound Ixion to a winged wheel, which revolved in the air in all directions for all eternity.  What does a flying out of control wheel have to do with this game?  Read on to found out![CR]Ixion is an interesting game that doesn't seem to play like anything else (this is a refreshing change from all the 'me too' clone games in the 2600 library).  The goal of the game is to grab the five white squares scattered across the screen and spell the word Ixion before time runs out.  This is strangely reminiscent of many of the games put out by Universal, where the player would have spell out the word Bonus by grabbing letters that would appear around the screen.  The game screen consists of a giant grid of 110 squares on which your ship (which looks like a small tank) can travel.  Your ship cannot travel over areas where squares are missing.  At the start of each level only certain squares are visible, to get around easier you will need to reveal the missing squares.  [CR]Reveling the missing squares is fairly simple, one simply has to move the brown sphere over an empty square.  The sphere is normally stationary, but it can be moved by shooting or ramming into it.  This sends the sphere bouncing around the screen, revealing squares and destroying enemies as it goes (hence the reference to Ixion's flying wheel).  After a short time of bouncing around the sphere will stop, requiring the player to move it again to reveal more squares.  Learning how to move the sphere to where you want to go is the key to mastering Ixion.[CR]Also moving around the game grid are enemy drones, which will attempt to destroy your ship.  Unfortunately in addition to your ship their shots also destroy tiles, making your path much more difficult to traverse.  Thankfully the drones appear to be bound by the same rules about traveling over tiles that you are, so there is no unfair advantage.  Aside from using the sphere as a weapon, your ship is armed with a powerful cannon that shoots three bullets and can be aimed in eight directions and bounce off walls.  Enemy drones only take one shot to defeat, but will take out the tile they are on when they explode.  Also make sure you keep an eye on the timer (represented by a drone slowly moving towards your reserve ships).  If the drone makes it to your reserve ships before you've spelled Ixion, you will lose a life.  This timer starts to move at amazing speed on the higher levels, so don't delay in hunting down those letters! [CR]After each level you will be treated to a small bonus round.  In these rounds the screen starts out without any tiles present, but there are two spheres.  Your goal on this screen is quickly reveal as many tiles as you can before the timer runs out.  Since there are no squares visible at the start of the round you will only be able to shoot the spheres at first, however as more squares are reveled you can start bumping the sphere to move it around even more.    If you are able to reveal all the squares (a very difficult feat) you will receive a large bonus.  There does not appear to be a penalty for not revealing all the squares (other than your wounded pride of course)[CR]Although Ixion starts off easy, the higher rounds are very intense.  Each successive round starts off with less squares visible at the start, and they're usually missing from the worst possible places.  The sphere also will get placed in harder to reach locations, making it difficult to grab at the start of the round.  The enemies begin to shoot faster and more often, and will respawn much faster after they are destroyed.  In the higher rounds it is not uncommon to destroy more squares than you reveal, simply by destroying the rapidly respawning drones.[CR]The graphics for Ixion are top notch, very impressive for the time in which is was created.  There is little, if any, flicker, and the sound effects get the job done (be sure to check out the warning sound that plays when running out of time, which appears to have been ripped off from Pac-Man).  The timer and score counter at the bottom of the screen look very similar to those used in Thunderground, this may mean that they had the same programmer or that the programmer simply borrowed code.  [CR]It is unknown why Ixion was never released, but it was around this time that Sega Enterprises (the American arm of Sega) was sold to Bally.  After this sale, all of Sega's 2600 titles were Bally Midway arcade games (Tapper, Spy Hunter, and Up n Down).  It may have been felt that only well known arcade game would sell well enough in the overly competitive 2600 market, or perhaps Ixion simply got lost in the transition shuffle?  Whatever the reason, the 2600 world was robbed of one of one of the most original and entertaining titles to grace the console.

				<plot>In James Bond 007 you control James Bond in his multi purpose craft. This craft can travel on both land and sea, can jump over danger, or fire at enemies on the many different levels. Each horizontally scrolling level in the game is loosely based on a different James Bond movie. The levels included are Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only. Each level has a variety of enemies trying to destroy you, and a unique goal that must be accomplished to continue on (for example, you may have to land on a hidden oil rig to stop Seraffino, or find Stromberg's undersea laboratory and destroy it). If you can complete all the missions, you win the game! Good luck, Mr. Bond.</plot>

				<title_clean>Journey Escape</title_clean>
				<plot>You're on the road with the rock band Journey! After each concert, your goal is to guide the five band members to the escape vehicle so they can get to the next concert on time. You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</plot>

				<title_clean>Jr. Pac-Man</title_clean>
				<plot>Jr. Pac-Man features gameplay similar to the original Pac-Man, but with a few changes. As Jr., you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Skip the intros[CR]To skip the musical intros on any level, press the button on the joystick.</plot>

				<title_clean>Kabobber</title_clean>
				<plot>Kabobber is just one of those games that defies definition.  Looking a bit like a cross between Q*Bert and Frogger, Kabobber is a game as strange as its name.  Along with Thwocker, Kabobber is one of the lost Activision titles that people all knew existed somewhere, but it wasn't until 2001 that a prototype was finally confirmed to exist and the rom was released.     Kabobber was never advertised or mentioned in any Activision catalogs.[CR]Since no instruction manual was ever made for Kabobber, we can only guess at what the storyline might have been.  Atari Age hosted a contest to come up with a story and manual that best fit the style of the game.  While we'll never know how close the winning entry was to the real storyline, it probably isn't too far off.  The story (such as it is) tells the tale of greedy Princess Buvsky who is attempting to devour the rainbow energy source of Kabobberland.  You must take your army of Buvskies and attempt to catch Princess Buvsky before she can reach the rainbow on the other side of the screen.  Along the way you must contend with the dangerous Kabobbers who are attempting to destroy your rescue party.[CR]The basic gameplay of Kabobber is very simple; you must hop on the enemy before he hops on you.  To help you gang up on the enemy you are given command of an army of Buvskies.  Your Buvskies troops appear in each of the squares immediately surrounding your character.  When first summoned your Buvskies are only babies who must first conquer an enemy Kabobber to be promoted to full strength.  Baby Buvskies can only conquer the green Guvskies and are crushed by all other enemies, so you must protect them until they reach full strength.  You are given a limited number of baby Buvskies (displayed at the bottom of the screen), although you can gain extra Buvskies by conquering enemy troops (you are limited to nine reserve Buvskies).  Your army moves with you in a square formation, so the more troops you have on the screen the bigger the target you are.  However the more troops you have the more enemies you can crush, and you'll have a less chance of being totally annihilated by a rampaging enemy mob.[CR]As the boards progress the enemies become faster and more numerous, and Princess Buvsky moves towards the rainbow faster.  The game ends once all your troops are lost or Princess Buvsky reaches the energy rainbow.  On the later levels it's all about strategy, simply jumping non-stop towards the Princess won't cut it anymore.  You must carefully decide which enemies are worth conquering, and which are best left alone.  Don't take too long however, as the Princess has her eye on the prize.[CR]Kabobber is an excellent action/strategy game by Rex Bradford, the man responsible for Jedi Arena and Empire Strikes Back.   So why did Kabobber never get released?  According to Rex:[CR]"What happened was that I "finished" the game in the standard 4K cartridge size, then Activision said they liked the game and would like me to expand it to an 8K cartridge and keep working on it.  I had basically run out of ideas for the game at that point, and resisted.  Anyway, I didn't feel like working on it more, and Activision didn't want to publish it as is (and was probably a little miffed at my attitude, though they never said so), and that was that."[CR]It's a shame Activision didn't want to release Kabobber as is, because it's a lot of fun and didn't really need anymore retooling.  Kabobber is proof that sometimes it's best to release games as is instead of reworking them to death.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/kabobber/kabobber.htm[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Kaboom!</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kaboom! is a single-screen action game, where the player catches bombs in a series of three buckets. With a gameplay style somewhat similar to Breakout, the player uses a paddle (2600 version) or joystick (5200 version) to control the action.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] takes place on a single screen. The Mad Bomber, at the top of the screen glides left and right while dropping bombs. The player controls a series of three buckets, which are used to catch the bombs before they land at the bottom of the screen. As gameplay progresses, the Mad Bomber moves and drops bombs more rapidly, increasing difficulty. Points are scored on a sliding scale; the more groups of bombs caught, the more points are awarded - 8 groups giving the maximum multiplier. Each bomb group comes faster, and has more bombs than the prior.Difficulty[CR]The difficulty switches control the width of the buckets. The 'B' level difficulty decreases the bucket size to less than half of the 'A' level difficulty. The difficulty does not affect scoring.Missed Bombs[CR]If the player misses a bomb, the score multiplier is reset, and the player loses a bucket, increasing the challenge on subsequent attempts. Gameplay resumes one bomb set prior to the current bomb set, but with half as many bombs to catch. When all buckets are gone, the game is over. Scoring 1000 points earns the player a new bucket, with a maximum of three earned buckets. Earned buckets may not be stockpiled; a player must earn 1000 points subsequent to losing a bucket to gain a new one. Because missed bombs lower the difficulty, a high level strategy is to purposely miss a bomb around the 900 mark, if successful the player will be easily able to regain an extra bucked while at the same time slowing the onslaught of bombs.Modes[CR]The Atari 2600 version of Kaboom! features 2-player alternating play, with independent difficulty selection. The 5200 version additionally supports a mode whereby players alternate between controlling the buckets, and the Mad Bomber.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Like all Activision releases of this era, the box, manual and cartridge label all feature the name of the designer of that particular game. In this case, Larry Kaplan. Additionally, Larry Kaplan provided several gameplay tips at the back of the instruction manual.[CR]The mad bomber has a "sad face" while dropping bombs, but a "happy face" if one gets by the player. A score of 10,000 points leads to an easter-egg: a surprised face, regardless of the action.[CR]As with many Activision games, a patch was available for excellent gameplay. Providing activision with a photograph of a score of 3000 or better would get that player a free "Bucket Brigade" patch.[CR]Activision released an LCD keychain version of the game in the early 1990s.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Surprise the bomber[CR]When you score at least 10,000 points, the bomber will be surprised.</plot>

				<title_clean>Kamikaze Saucers</title_clean>
				<plot>Kamikaze Saucers was a little known 2600 game that most people assumed was never even started.  However after the programmer gave the rom image to Atari Age to be distributed to the gaming community, the game proved to be very much real.  There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it.  All these things make this prototype all the more interesting, and makes one wonder what other games Syncro may have had in the works.[CR]Kamikaze Saucers is your average shooter along the lines of Atlantis or Demon Attack.  You must shoot down the saucers that buzz across the screen using your oversized phallic looking ship.  If if fail to shoot the saucers down in a timely manner they will go Kamikaze on you big time!  Three large ships will come at you from the top of the screen, and if you can't destroy them before they crash into you you'll lose a life.[CR]Thankfully there's a little more to Kamikaze Saucers than mindless shooting.  Notice the two meters on each side of the screen?  These are your ammo meters, the left meter is for shooting from the left and the right meter for shooting on the right.  For some reason, shooting from the center counts as shooting from the left (as far as ammo is concerned).  The shooting in KS is a bit like Atlantis, all your shots are aimed towards the center of the screen.  So shooting from the left or right will cause your shots to angle towards the center like shooting from Atlantis's side guns.  This takes a bit to get used to, but actually makes the game more challenging.[CR]While Kamikaze Saucers isn't a bad game, it's nothing special.  In the "Me Too" clone environment that caused the great crash, Kamikaze Saucers would hardly get noticed.  Syncro made the right decision in staying out of the crumbling market, especially with lackluster games like this.  Kamikaze Saucers is just one of many victims of bad timing.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/kamikaze/kamikaze.htm[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Kangaroo</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR]Kangaroo, released in 1983 and then again with silver box label in 1988, was the story of a mother kangaroo searching for her kidnapped baby.  The game utilized the Atari 2600 joystick to help mother maneuver, "Donkey Kong" type level designs.  Every different direction on the joystick would send mother ducking or leaping from ledges or to collect scattered fruit for points.  The red button on the joystick controlled her "boxing," which was frequently needed to fight of the onslaught of evil monkeys bent on keeping baby kangaroo kidnapped.  The game was remembered as being especially difficult as you start the game with 3 lives and no continues.Kangaroo is another gem by yesterday's standards, but remains a formidable challenge to any newcomer to the games design.In one of the levels that broke with the game's usual ascent format, your joey is on top of a column of monkeys that you must punch repeatedly in order to knock each monkey out from other the platform your joey is on.  You punch the HELL out of those monkeys, I can tell you.The game uses Stephen Foster's song "O! Suzanna!" to signal level completion (when your little joey says MOM in big letters after you rescue him or her).  When ringing the bell to bring in the next selection of fruit, you hear the Westminster Quarters song (often heard in college campuses). As you get closer to the top of each level a gorilla will come out and want to box you.  It's best to avoid him and keep going till you reach the top.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</plot>

				<title_clean>Kung Fu</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kung Fu Master follows Thomas, an expert in the art of Kung Fu, through five side-scrolling floors filled with the relentless attacks of Mr X's minions. Thomas must prove his might in order to rescue his girlfriend, Sylvia, from the clutches of this evil maniac before it is too late. The game was originally released in Japan as Spartan X, the Japanese title for Jackie Chan's 1984 Hong Kong movie Wheels on Meals.[CR]The game was originally released for arcades in 1984, before being ported to home systems. It had a sequel, Vigilante, released for arcades in 1988. It was the first in the Spartan X series of video games.[CR]The game was highly influential in its time. It created a new genre of video games, the beat 'em up. Its designer Takashi Nishiyama also later went on to create Street Fighter, which itself went on to define the fighting game genre. In the film industry, the game was used to help promote Jackie Chan's film Wheels on Meals in Japan, and the game later inspired a 1988 French film of the same name.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Enemies include the huge number of Mr X's lowest form of help - The men dressed in purple who are bent on grabbing Thomas and causing as much damage as possible (when they do grab Thomas, his only hope becomes the age old kung fu move of waggling). There are also men dressed in blue who are a great shot with the old throwing knife. Other enemies include fire breathing dragons, glowing orbs that propel some sort of bullet, poisonous moths, small snakes and even smaller kung fu dwarves.[CR]Each level of Mr X's dojo features a boss that Thomas must defeat with all his might if he is to proceed up the stairs taking him ever closer to the final boss.[CR]Floor one will have Thomas defeat a ruffian with a bat while floor two will test his might against a foe skilled in the art of boomerang throwing.[CR]Once Thomas has passed floor two, the bosses become more complex and a daunting task is put before him.[CR]Floor three pins Thomas against an angry giant while floor four forces him to battle a Magician of magical proportions.[CR]Once Thomas has reached the end of the fifth and final floor, he will be confronted by Mr X - the Kung Fu master.[CR]Alternate Titles[CR]The original name of Kung-Fu Master is Spartan X in Japan. It was released in US arcades as Kung-Fu Master and shortened to Kung Fu for the NES version of the game. The Famicom version of the game is known as Spartan X, but Famicom cartridges labelled Kung Fu are known to exist in Japan and are assumed to be something of a rarity. Kung Fu was a launch title for the NES.[CR]On April 28, 2011, Kung-Fu Master was released for the Apple iPad. It featured all five levels and is the same graphically as the arcade version.[CR]Related Films[CR]Wheels on Meals (Spartan X)[CR]In Japan, the game is named after Spartan X, the Japanese title for the 1984 Hong Kong action movie Wheels on Meals, starring Jackie Chan as Thomas, a Chinese mobile fast food vendor in Barcelona, Spain. The plot of the game, and the climax of the film, involves storming a villain's castle to save Sylvia.[CR]Alongside Jackie Chan, the film Wheels on Meals also starred Sammo Hung and Yuen Baio in supporting roles, US martial arts champion Benny "The Jet" Urquidez as the villain's top henchman, and former Miss Spain, Lola Forner, as love interest (and damsel in distress) Sylvia.[CR]While based on Wheels on Meals, the setting appears to be originally inspired by Bruce Lee's final film, Game of Death, shortly before his death in 1973. Like the film, the game revolves around rescuing a damsel in distress at the top of a Chinese pagoda and fighting bad guys on each floor along the way. It was not long before the game's release that Irem decided to release it as a tie-in to Wheels on Meals, helping to bring more attention to the game in Japan.[CR]The game's environments more closely resembles Chinese architecture (much like Game of Death) rather than the Spanish castle of Wheels on Meals. Sylvia in the game also looks Chinese, whereas Sylvia in Wheels in Meals was Spanish. In addition, the original arcade version gives Thomas a voice more closely resembling Bruce Lee rather than the Jackie Chan character. In the NES port of the game as well as the 1988 arcade sequel Vigilante, the voice more closely resembles Jackie Chan.Kung-Fu Master![CR]The game itself went on to inspire a 1988 live-action French film of the same name. Director Agn&#232;s Varda featured the game prominently in the film Kung-Fu Master! It deals with a relationship between a 40 year-old woman and a 14 year-old boy obsessed with the game. The film was retitled Le Petit Amour for U.S. release so it would not be perceived as a martial arts film.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Kung Fu Master</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kung Fu Master follows Thomas, an expert in the art of Kung Fu, through five side-scrolling floors filled with the relentless attacks of Mr X's minions. Thomas must prove his might in order to rescue his girlfriend, Sylvia, from the clutches of this evil maniac before it is too late. The game was originally released in Japan as Spartan X, the Japanese title for Jackie Chan's 1984 Hong Kong movie Wheels on Meals.[CR]The game was originally released for arcades in 1984, before being ported to home systems. It had a sequel, Vigilante, released for arcades in 1988. It was the first in the Spartan X series of video games.[CR]The game was highly influential in its time. It created a new genre of video games, the beat 'em up. Its designer Takashi Nishiyama also later went on to create Street Fighter, which itself went on to define the fighting game genre. In the film industry, the game was used to help promote Jackie Chan's film Wheels on Meals in Japan, and the game later inspired a 1988 French film of the same name.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Enemies include the huge number of Mr X's lowest form of help - The men dressed in purple who are bent on grabbing Thomas and causing as much damage as possible (when they do grab Thomas, his only hope becomes the age old kung fu move of waggling). There are also men dressed in blue who are a great shot with the old throwing knife. Other enemies include fire breathing dragons, glowing orbs that propel some sort of bullet, poisonous moths, small snakes and even smaller kung fu dwarves.[CR]Each level of Mr X's dojo features a boss that Thomas must defeat with all his might if he is to proceed up the stairs taking him ever closer to the final boss.[CR]Floor one will have Thomas defeat a ruffian with a bat while floor two will test his might against a foe skilled in the art of boomerang throwing.[CR]Once Thomas has passed floor two, the bosses become more complex and a daunting task is put before him.[CR]Floor three pins Thomas against an angry giant while floor four forces him to battle a Magician of magical proportions.[CR]Once Thomas has reached the end of the fifth and final floor, he will be confronted by Mr X - the Kung Fu master.[CR]Alternate Titles[CR]The original name of Kung-Fu Master is Spartan X in Japan. It was released in US arcades as Kung-Fu Master and shortened to Kung Fu for the NES version of the game. The Famicom version of the game is known as Spartan X, but Famicom cartridges labelled Kung Fu are known to exist in Japan and are assumed to be something of a rarity. Kung Fu was a launch title for the NES.[CR]On April 28, 2011, Kung-Fu Master was released for the Apple iPad. It featured all five levels and is the same graphically as the arcade version.[CR]Related Films[CR]Wheels on Meals (Spartan X)[CR]In Japan, the game is named after Spartan X, the Japanese title for the 1984 Hong Kong action movie Wheels on Meals, starring Jackie Chan as Thomas, a Chinese mobile fast food vendor in Barcelona, Spain. The plot of the game, and the climax of the film, involves storming a villain's castle to save Sylvia.[CR]Alongside Jackie Chan, the film Wheels on Meals also starred Sammo Hung and Yuen Baio in supporting roles, US martial arts champion Benny "The Jet" Urquidez as the villain's top henchman, and former Miss Spain, Lola Forner, as love interest (and damsel in distress) Sylvia.[CR]While based on Wheels on Meals, the setting appears to be originally inspired by Bruce Lee's final film, Game of Death, shortly before his death in 1973. Like the film, the game revolves around rescuing a damsel in distress at the top of a Chinese pagoda and fighting bad guys on each floor along the way. It was not long before the game's release that Irem decided to release it as a tie-in to Wheels on Meals, helping to bring more attention to the game in Japan.[CR]The game's environments more closely resembles Chinese architecture (much like Game of Death) rather than the Spanish castle of Wheels on Meals. Sylvia in the game also looks Chinese, whereas Sylvia in Wheels in Meals was Spanish. In addition, the original arcade version gives Thomas a voice more closely resembling Bruce Lee rather than the Jackie Chan character. In the NES port of the game as well as the 1988 arcade sequel Vigilante, the voice more closely resembles Jackie Chan.Kung-Fu Master![CR]The game itself went on to inspire a 1988 live-action French film of the same name. Director Agn&#232;s Varda featured the game prominently in the film Kung-Fu Master! It deals with a relationship between a 40 year-old woman and a 14 year-old boy obsessed with the game. The film was retitled Le Petit Amour for U.S. release so it would not be perceived as a martial arts film.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Kyphus</title_clean>
				<plot>Over the years Apollo has released some strange games.  From the airline luggage simulator Lost Luggage to the egg throwing antics of Wabbit, Apollo was never afraid to release something different.  Therefore it's no surprise that when a new unknown Apollo prototype surfaced, it featured some interesting gameplay.  However Kyphus may be the strangest game from Apollo yet... [CR]Looking a little like a cross between Racquetball and Space Cavern, Kyphus is an odd game in which the player must maneuver a dumpy looking guy through a pseudo-3D maze of rooms avoiding what appears to be a glowing cloud that shoots lasers, while being followed by a multi-colored robot that just might be a monkey in disguise.  Like I said, this game is weird!.[CR]Unfortunately, this prototype is very incomplete.  There appears to be no collision detection, few sounds, and almost no gameplay.  The only thing one can really do in this prototype is to move run from room to room, although with no collision detection implemented there is no threat from the robot or cloud.  Each room of the maze appears to have a different color, and has three to four exits (two on the sides and one at the top and bottom).  The maze is made up of 64 rooms, but doesn't appear to have a set pattern. [CR]As you move through maze, you may notice the score and life counters start displaying odd letters and numbers.  These number and letters are actually variable values in hex decimal notation.  The programmer used these numbers to help determine the values of various game variables while developing the game.  The counters at the top of the screen display the players position coordinates, the left two digits in the score are a timer of some sort that is continually counting down, while the right two digits appear to be the room number.  It is unusual to see these in game unless it is very early in the development cycle. [CR]Although the prototype isn't very playable, by taking a look in the game itself we can puzzle out some planned gameplay.  Hidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy, and Invoke.  It is thought that these are commands the player would give the robot to make it do certain things.  Also hidden in the game code are graphics for what appears to be a large monkey that would have replaced the robot.  It is currently unknown how the monkey would be used in the game, and there is no way to trigger it (without hacking the code) in the current prototype. [CR]Although Kyphus is unplayble in its current state, it shows quite a bit of promise.  Getting the 2600 to display anything that looks remotely like 3D is an amazing feat.  It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear.  Hopefully a more complete version of the game will turn up someday, but for now we can be happy in that another lost prototype has finally been found.

				<plot>Laser Gates is a side scrolling shooter. Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the force fields.</plot>

				<title_clean>Lasercade</title_clean>
				<plot>Best described as a 3-D shooting gallery, Lasercade is an odd little game designed by Videa, the same company that created the similarly unreleased Meltdown for 20th Century Fox.  However while Meltdown had a "frenzied fun" factor going for it, there's something... lacking about Lasercade. [CR]The first thing you're bound to notice upon booting Lasercade is how nice the graphics look.  It's hard to believe that the 2600 can do a 3/4th perspective shooting game, but Lasercade is the proof.  The goal of the game is to shoot all the targets in the upper section of the screen before time runs out (that's original).  However, while you can just start shooting willy nilly, you should probably take a second to look at the funny little targets in the middle section of the screen. [CR]In the middle section of the the screen there are three rotating mirrors.  As you may have guessed, these mirrors can play havoc with your laser if you're not careful.  If you shoot a mirror while it is facing you, it will reflect the laser back at you and you will lose some time and be momentarily stunned.  However if you shoot the mirror while its back is to you, you can destroy it so it won't bother you until the next round.  While this may sound a bit complicated, it's often best just to ignore the mirrors and shoot at the targets themselves.  The number of mirrors can be controlled with the left difficulty switch. [CR]The first round starts off with four targets for you to destroy (a light bulb, a dragon, a firecracker, and a lamp).  Each new round adds an extra target to hit, each one getting smaller and smaller. If you're successful in shooting all the targets in a given round, you will have a shot of some bonus points in the form of some fancy trick shooting.  Between each round a candelabra will appear with three flames, you must shoot one of the flames before the candles burn down.  Shooting the flame is more a matter of luck than skill, as the collision detection seems to be a bit off here.  As the rounds progress, you will be given less and less time to hit the targets.  If you manage to get through all 16 rounds you will be granted a large bonus.[CR]While Lasercade isn't a bad game, it lacks that "something" that keeps you coming back for more.  Lasercade plays more like a fancy tech demo than a real game.  It's easy to see why 20th Century Fox opted for the graphically challenged, but infinitely more fun, Meltdown over Lasercade.  Still, Lasercade is a good choice if you want to see how nice 2600 graphics could be. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/lasercade/lasercade.htm[CR]</plot>

In the middle of the screen is a shark cage where you begin. As you collect diamonds you need to bring them back to the shark cage in order to earn points. Swimming back and forth constantly is a deadly shark. If the shark encounters any of the diamonds, it will eat them; likewise you can also be eaten by the shark, causing you to lose a life. You have no defense against the shark, however you are immune if you are in the shark cage and the doors are closed. Somewhere in the maze the Loch Ness monster remains hidden. If you disturb the monster, it will continuously chase you unless you can lead it back into one of the caves located in the corners of the screen.</plot>

				<plot>During WWII German bombers turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Most bombs exploded on impact but some would sit for hours, days or weeks before detonating. It was up to the Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXB's) before they exploded. As a Lance Corporal in the Royal Engineers, it is your job to defuse these bombs.[CR]First, you will check your London map to see where the bombs are. Then it is defusing time. [CR]On the C64, you must use the joystick to cause the dial to rotate, changing the numbers next to a switch then clicking on the disarm switch at the bottom. If the number is wrong, you must change it again and keep trying. [CR]On the Atari 2600, you slide a sliding bar. On green bombs, the top bar controls the left switch, the middle the middle and the bottom the right.You set the slide to a spot the move to the switches and push right. On orange bombs, what slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb and on blue bombs, you can't control the switches. They just randomly change and you push right and hope you disarm in time.[CR]The possible ranks are:[CR]Lance Corporal[CR]Corporal[CR]Sargent[CR]Staff Sargent[CR]Warrant Officer[CR]Second Lieutenant[CR]First Lieutenant[CR]Captain[CR]At the start of the game, you can select which rank to start at, from Lance Corporal to Second Lieutenant on the C64 or from Lance Corporal to First Lieutenant on the Atari 2600.[CR]Every time you disarm a bomb, you move up levels within your rank. Move up eight levels and you are promoted. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage, you are demoted a level in rank.[CR]You lose the game is you are demoted below Lance Corporal or a bomb explodes while you are near it, a not-very-healthy thing to happen.[CR]You win if you get promoted to Captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.</plot>

				<title_clean>Looping</title_clean>
				<plot>Based on the obscure 1981 Venture Line coin-op of the same name, Looping is one of the few prototypes that was known to be 'out there', but could not be located.  Thankfully Looping finally surfaced in 2003 and was released to the gaming community.  Amazingly the 2600 version of Looping plays very close to the Colecovision original with the requisite downgrade in graphics and sound of course.  However since Looping wasn't exactly a graphical masterpiece to begin with, the downgrade isn't really all that noticeable.[CR]As the game title suggests, this game involves looping.  By looping I mean that your plane can only move in circles instead up the normal up, down ,left, right movement of most games.  By pushing up or down, your plane will begin to arch and start its loop (pushing left and right has no effect).  Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem, but your plane also moves very VERY fast, so it's quite easy to crash into the ground or another obstacle before your can complete your loop.  One interesting thing to note is that if your plane hits the top of the screen it will nosedive straight down.  While at first this may seem like a major inconvenience, it can be used to your advantage if you're crafty enough. [CR]Looping is separated into two main sections: The Airfield and The Pipe Maze.  Each level begins on the runway of the airfield where you must start the game by successfully taking off (just pull down on the stick).  Assuming you didn't crash into the building at the end of the runway, you're now airborne and can begin to complete your mission.  There are three possible missions depending on what level you are playing: Destroy the Terminal, Destroy the Missile, or Destroy the Terminal and Missile.  To destroy your target, you're going to have to shoot through the blocks that make up the structure, which as you may have guessed is easier said than done.  Since your plane is constantly moving at high speed you can only take a few shots at your target before passing it over (or flying into it if you're not too talented).  Also making your life miserable are several balloons which bounce around the screen at alarming speed.  Although you can shoot these balloons you end up crashing into them more often than not.  [CR]If you succeed in destroying your target it will turn gray and the gate at the far end of the Airfield will open revealing the next section of the game.[CR]The Pipe Maze (as the name suggests) is a huge maze of pipes which you must fly though in order to reach "The End".  The first room in this maze is fairly open, with several paths to take to the next room.  The main enemy in this room is a large green drop of ooze which constantly drips from one of the pipe opening.  This drop is fairly easy to avoid unless you take the top route which takes you right next to it (so try and take the bottom route).  The second room is very similar to the first, except it contains a "monster" which bounces around the top right corner.  Destroy the monster quickly and move to the final room.[CR]The final room is one of the most difficult areas of the game.  To reach "The End" you must maneuver past three bouncing balls that are blocking the entrances to the small inner room.  Thankfully you can shoot these balls if it looks like you're about to crash, but lining up a shot can be difficult since you're still moving at a high rate of speed.  Once you make it inside you've got one last ball to deal with before you can reach the end of the level.  After touching the finish line you will begin a new and more difficult level.[CR]It's unknown why Looping was never released since it seems to be finished and was even advertised.  One reason may be the high difficulty of the game which really takes away most of the fun.  Difficulty aside, Looping would have made an excellent addition to the 2600 library, and is one of the best Coleco games overall.  It appears that Coleco was finally learning after several titles of questionable quality (Donkey Kong anyone?).[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/looping/looping.htm[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You are at the airport attempting to collect your luggage from the carousel. However, the carousel has gone out of control and is tossing luggage everywhere! You need to catch all of the luggage that is tossed out, or all of your clothes will be scattered around the airport. As the levels progress, more and more luggage will need to be caught, and the games speed increases. There are two difficulty levels available; the easier mode gives you two men to catch luggage with, and the harder mode gives you only one man. Several other game variations are also available: if the terrorist suitcase option is enabled, explosive suitcases will occasionally appear. If you don't catch these, the game immediately ends regardless of how many lives you have left. If the suitcase control option is enabled during a two player game, you are able to control the direction your opponents suitcases travel.</plot>

				<title_clean>M*A*S*H</title_clean>
				<plot>ObjectiveM*A*S*H is 1 or 2 player game pitting you against, either the computer or a friend, in a race to save the most wounded soldiers. The more soldiers you save the more points you get, and the first to reach 999 points is the winner and savior.GameplayIn the default game type, the first objective is to retrieve wounded from the battlefield to your M*A*S*H (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) via helicopter. Your chopper may carry up to five soldiers before it has to go drop them off at the hospital, There are two minor obstacles hindering you from achieving your mission. The first most apparent type of obstacles are the trees. These aren't much of a factor but do sometimes create bottlenecks when trying to move around your opponent or trying to dodge the second type of obstacle, Anti-Aircraft fire. One solitary unit firing at both you and your opponent. If you get hit, you fall from the sky and you get dragged off the screen by a salvage vehicle costing you precious time. But this is still only a minor annoyance seeing that one second after the wreckage leaves the screen another helicopter appears at your M*A*S*H ready to go pick up more soldiers. After a set amount of time, this first part of the game suddenly stops and you move on to the second objective, operating on the wounded. This new screen reminds me of the board game Operation. All you see is a poorly drawn, really fat man, with shrapnel in his body that you must remove in order to save him. Using the tool given, you must pick up that shrapnel/bullet and guide it through the maze and out of the body. On each successful surgery you gain points, and move on to the next patient. On the other hand if you bump the fragment against the body, or edge of the maze, a hideous buzzing sound akin to Operation lets you know you have killed the patient. Then, staying true to the source material, you are promptly called a Ferret Face. The consequence of killing your patient is that you and lose the opportunity to save any more. Once again assuming you keep saving them you only have a set amount of time to save as many as you can.VariantsThere is one major variant to this game. As opposed to picking up soldiers from the ground and bringing them back to base, there is a mode where you and your opponent must catch soldiers being dropped from the sky by a jet. Once again this only lasts for a set amount of time before moving on to the operating table part of the game. Also there are couple of difficulty changes including: smaller helicopters which makes it easier to navigate through trees, and provides a smaller target for the AA gun, and the second possible change being the lack of AA gunfire.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You are Commander Harrington "Harry" Crag of the starship "Endless Search". You are put into a Malagai base for repairs but now the Malagai are holding you ransom. They want your advanced technology.[CR]There are three airlock doors per starbase. You must get the correct key for each door. Each is held by one of three Malagai. The order of which Malagai is holding which key is shown by the pictures above the starbase.[CR]If you are away from your assigned compartment for too long, as indicated by the line at the bottom of the screen, the Malagai will attack and you will need to return to your compartment to make them friendly again. When you touch a Malagai and, if it is the correct one, get the airlock door key, the Malagai will attack and the airlock will flash, on most game variations (see below). You must then make your way to the airlock. One door will disappear and the Malagai will become friendly again. After you open the third door, it is off to the next starbase.[CR]After the third (blue) starbase, you get an extra man.[CR]Game Variations:[CR]Version 1: All the Malagai have different shapes and colors[CR]Version 2: All the Malagai have the same shape but different colors[CR]Version 3: All Malagai are the same shape and color and the airlocks do not blink to show you got the right key.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Touch a Malagai while they're friendly=100 points (50 point bonus if it has the correct key)[CR]Open airlocks one or two=100 points[CR]Open airlock three to exit starbase orange or teal=150 points[CR]Open airlock three to exit blue starbase=250 points[CR]Difficulty switches set to "B"=10 seconds from compartment before Malagai attack[CR]Difficulty switches set to "A"=15 seconds from compartment before Malagai attack[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Mode[CR]Begin a game, then select another variation and resume. Before the screen clears completely, select a variation, but do not confirm. Instead, hold down, and the main character will pop out from the top of the screen. You can now move around freely without any enemies (Malagai.) Depending on how much of the screen did not completely clear from the transition of one variation to another is what is left visible, along with the character, within the level. What was cleared is, in fact, just invisible.</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Mangia was a video game produced in 1983 by SpectraVideo. In the game the player controls a small boy who must eat or discard of continuous plates of pasta that are passed to the player by the protaganist's mother.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay of Mangia is unique to say the least.[CR]The player must control a young boy eating. The player must continuously eat plates of pasta placed in front of him by his mother. The mother will keep feeding the player pasta until his stomach explodes on-screen! The main goal of the game is for the player to prevent the eventual stomach explosion while still satisfying the player&#8217;s mother.[CR]The player can instead of eating the pasta, toss food to the player&#8217;s pets, a cat and a dog. The cat will occasionally appear at the window and the dog is at the bottom of the screen. The player must get caught passing the food to the pets. If caught the player will be penalized. If the mother sees the pasta being passed away, she will bring even more pasta on the next round[CR]The game&#8217;s character is controlled by the player by pressing right to cause the main character to grab a plate of pasta, pressing left to eat the pasta. The player can press up or down to toss the pasta to the cat or the dog. If the cat and dog are not on screen when the food is passed to them, the mother will return with even more pasta that the player must eat.[CR]The player also cannot simply remain idle. Pasta will accumulate on the table, until the table breaks. Then the player lose a turn.[CR]Lastly if the player attempts to eat all the pasta without passing any to the cat or dog will cause the player&#8217;s character&#8217;s stomach to swell and swell and finally explode.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You've landed on an alien planet and penetrated the enemy base defended by armed attack robots. Your mission is to find your way to the heart of the base and to destroy the power center of the enemy's weapon system.[CR]You start on the right side of a room, randomly selected. You must make your way though various rooms, killing or avoiding the four robots as you go. You need to find the power center and shoot it to clear that level. You must do this before the timer at the bottom runs out. Once you shoot the power center, you will get the remaining time as bonus.  You are then sent to a new room to start again but now there are five robots per room. Get the power center again and there will be six per room. Get the power center again and you return to four robots per room but faster. In some rooms, you will randomly find a magic armor that will make you invulnerable for a short time.</plot>

				<title_clean>Mario's Bros.</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario Bros. is the first in a long line of Mario Bros. titles, although its differences from the later games are significant.[CR]Comparison to other Mario Games[CR]Mario Bros. Firsts[CR]Mario - initially called Jumpman - was introduced in Nintendo's first Donkey Kong video game. There, his only offensive ability was the hammer which, like Pac-Man's power pellets, were limited in number and duration. Here, Mario has an ongoing offensive power, one that he would use throughout the sequels, that of jumping under a thing that is standing on a ledge above. While this is usually an optional attack in the later games, for Mario Bros. it's vital for finishing a given stage. Punching underneath a monster flips it over or changes its color (in lieu of flipping it over). Only when upside down is a monster safe to touch. Should Mario touch a monster, he actually boots it into the water at the bottom of the screen, scoring points and defeating the enemy. Other firsts which would find their way into later Mario Bros. titles:This game was the first appearance of the iconic turtle enemy called the Shell Creeper, later dubbed the Koopa Troopa. Mario could not, however, jump on their backs as he could later, even though the Shell Creepers and Koopa Troopas look nearly identical.Shining sewer pipes, too, made their first appearance. This time they serve as monster dispensers, and reminders that game takes place in a sewer.Many things fall into the sewers, including baby turtles which grow up to be Shell Creepers, but another iconic thing that might get lost in a storm drain is a coin. Thus, coins are brought in as extra scoring items every time an enemy is killed. If Mario picks them up before they reach the bottom of the screen, the player gets extra points.The POW block, used to flip all the monsters over who are currently standing on a surface, is later employed in other Super Mario games (though its "zapper-like" abilities are changed).Fireballs also make an appearance, looking a bit more like the fireballs Mario and Luigi throw when they've picked up a flower in Super Mario Bros., but fireballs in this game are enemies.And last, but not least, the simultaneous two-player mode introduces Luigi, a swapped-palette Mario.Elements Unique to Mario Bros.[CR]Many elements in Mario Bros. did not get picked up for later installments of the Mario Bros. series. Other enemies, such as the hopping Fighter Flies, ice-patch creating Slipice blobs, and crabby Sidesteppers are seen nowhere else. Neither is the complex punching-under-then-hopping-up-to-kill-the-monster mechanic, although there are certain situations in later games where this is a viable tactic. Touching an enemy when it isn't supine brings instant death, and possibly the most notable difference is that the game is largely defensive. In Donkey Kong before it, and all Super Mario games after, Mario as a player character is largely the mover, moving the game from scene to scene. Here Mario and Luigi defend territory until they win - the scenery eventually changes, but only slightly.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>WANTED: A master builder to create structures per blueprints for Spectraville. To apply, insert cartridge into Atari 2600 and power on machine.[CR]You are shown what you are to build for 5 seconds. To get the bricks, go to either side of the screen and press in that direction. To lay a brick, press fire then down. When Spectradog comes on the screen, you must jump over him by pushing the joystick to the upper right or upper left or he will make you lose one life. As the building gets higher, the kid will steal the ladder. When the brat appears on the screen, you must get off the ladder or you will fall and lose one life. When the building gets to be several stories high, you must be leery of staying on the very top as lightning may strike and lose you a life. When you lose a life, you drop any bricks you were carrying.[CR]Once the building is complete, you go all the way up the ladder and push up to call the helicopter to take you to the next site. If the building is not correct, the helicopter will pick you up but then drop you near the edge of the screen, losing you a life. There are game selections for unlimited time but limited bricks and unlimited bricks but limited time.</plot>

				<title_clean>Masters of the Universe - The Power of He-Man</title_clean>
				<plot>In Masters of the Universe, you control He-Man as he battles Skeletor in two different types of arcade action scenes. In the first part of the game, you control the Wind Raider flying towards Castle Grayskull. You have a limited amount of fuel with which to reach your destination, plus numerous fireballs will be flying around the screen trying to stop you and Skeletor will be running along the ground. The Wind Raider is equipped with bombs and guns which can be used to defend yourself from the fireballs, and also can earn bonus points if you can hit Skeletor. The second part of the game takes place on foot. When you've landed near the castle, He-Man needs to pursue Skeletor. Skeletor will be firing numerous lightning bolts which can be blocked with a shield. There is a time limit here, and you must get past all of the screens and catch Skeletor before time runs out. If you are successful, the game will repeat at a tougher skill level.</plot>

				<plot>In Maze Craze, your goal is to be the first of two players to make it out of a maze! Each player controls a cop that starts on the left, and the first player to make it out the exit on the right wins. The game also includes of variety of options. The maze can be completely visible, completely invisible, or have just a few parts invisible. With invisible mazes you can optionally have the computer provide a sneak peak at the complete maze periodically. To make your task more challenging, one to five robbers may also be placed in the maze. If you are caught by one of the robbers, you will momentarily be stunned giving your opponent an advantage. You can also give your cop the ability to set up a blockade to confuse your opponent. This will look like a regular wall, however you can walk straight through it. The games speed can also be adjusted, from calculatingly slow to extremely fast.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Megamania is an Atari 2600 shoot em up game released in 1982 by Activision. It was designed by Steve Cartwright, and was later ported to Atari 8-bit and Atari 5200, with some minor interface/graphical improvements, by Glyn Anderson. Insofar as the game has a plot, it takes place in a Space Nightmare, brought on by the protagonist, a pilot on an intergalactic space cruiser, consuming two pepperoni pizzas and a quart of chocolate mint ice cream. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Megamania is a fairly traditional shoot em up.[CR]The player controls a spaceship visually similar to the Starship Enterprise armed with a laser cannon. A time restraint in the form of an contiuously dwindling energy bar is displayed on the bottom of the screen, and when this runs out, the player loses one of his three initial ships. The ship can be moved left and right, and shoot, and that is the full extent of the player's control of it. [CR]As usual with Atari 2600 games, the game has several gameplay modes; the player can select to have missiles that follow the sideways motion of the spaceship, or missiles that fire straight, independent of the spaceship. The game's enemies feature a typically early 80s variety of random foodstuffs and geometric shapes, which come at your space ship in increasingly intricate patterns as you progress through the levels. [CR]Scoring is performed by killing enemies, and the points awarded for each kill increase from level to level. The player is also awarded for finishing levels quickly, as the remaining energy bar is also tallied into the score. Should the total score exceed 999.999 points, the game crashes, as a result of a programming error. [CR]The lyrics to the theme song bear mentioning. It was performed by The Tubes, a San Fransisco-based rock band. [CR]"Mega! Megamania. Megamania!! [CR]It's gonna drive you insane. [CR]You've got to shoot to survive, [CR]you've got to run to stay alive! [CR]You may regret it, [CR]the day you get it- [CR]It's never gonna let you alone!"[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Meltdown</title_clean>
				<plot>Not to be confused with the Atari game by the same name (which was released for the 7800), Meltdown was one of the final 20th Century Fox titles to be developed (Crash Dive was the absolute last) but was never released.  Why TCF decided to cancel Meltdown is unknown, but was most likely due to the collapsing video game market.  The decision to cancel the game must have been made at the last moment, as advertisements proudly boasting "Just Released" had already been printed.  Although Meltdown was displayed at the 1983 CES show, it was never seen again after the show closed.  Long thought lost, Meltdown surfaced in a resale shop in 2004 where by chance it was discovered by a passing collector.  [CR]Meltdown is basically a game of hide and seek that place on a 4x4 grid of atoms.  At the start of each round you will see a rogue quark move about the reactor agitating the atoms.  Each time the quark touches one of atoms it will strip off some of the electrons and atom will shrink.  Once an atom has lost all it's electrons it will become unstable, if all the atoms destabilize the reactor will blow![CR]As the only remaining scientist, it is up to you to destroy the quarks and cool down the reactor.   To accomplish this you will have to make use of the only two tools at your disposal: an atomic stabilizer and Cadmium rods.  When the quark jumps to an atom you must line up the stabilizer (on the X axis), line up the Cadmium tube (on the Y axis), and quickly insert a Cadmium rod by pressing the fire button.  However as soon as you destroy one quark another one appears to take its place, so be vigilant and don't let your guard down for a moment.  [CR]The core temperature is represented by a bar displayed at the top of the screen.  As the core cools down, the bar will grow longer, once the bar reaches the center of the screen the reactor will come back under control and the reactor will be saved (for the moment).  Each time you successfully save the reactor the action will get more intense; the number of quarks will multiply, they will begin to move faster, and the electrons will strip off more easily.  Once you reach the 10,000 mark, missing even one quark will likely blow the reactor.[CR]Meltdown is an simple, yet amazingly addictive game.  It's interesting graphical style and progressive difficulty ramping makes Meltdown a game that's hard to put down.  It's a shame that 20th Century Fox never released Meltdown, as it is one of their better titles.  Like many TCF games, Meltdown was not developed by Fox themselves, but rather by a small company called Videa.  Videa eventually became Sente Technologies before being acquired by Bally and becoming the well known Bally Sente. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/meltdown/meltdown.htm[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Mind Maze</title_clean>
				<plot>A game based on ESP?  Yes you heard me right, Mind Maze is the first (and only) Atari game to be based on the unproven (yet still popular) theory of ESP (Extra Sensory Perception).  It appears Atari was attempting to develop a sort of "Mind Reading" game for its new Mindlink controller.  So can the 2600 really read your thoughts?  Read on to find out...[CR]Mind Maze is played somewhat like those old mind reading experiments where a scientist would hold up a card and ask a person to tell him what was on the other side.  Depending on the game selected, two to four cards appear on the screen each round.  The player then must try and guess the "correct" card by highlighting it (using the joystick) and pressing the fire button.  Unfortunately this is where the game begins to fall apart.  As you've probably guessed the theory of ESP is pretty far fetched, and the odds that the player can continually guess the correct card is slim.  So the player must simply sit there and randomly select cards until he by chance selects the correct one.  Predictably, this gets boring very fast... [CR]After choosing a card all but one of the card pictures will disappear, and the computer will then highlight the "correct" card on the screen.  If the player is playing with the "Race" option, the game will show a solid blue screen and wait for the player to press a button before continuing to the next round.  This blue screen (which would have been spruced up for the final release) was probably there to allow the other player to get ready for his turn.  However since there is no two player option in this version, it doesn't really serve any point.  The player may also "pass" on the current set of cards by pressing the button without selecting a card.  This will cause a new set of cards to appear but it will still be the players turn.  There doesn't seem to be a limit on the number of times you can pass, but the game will not advance until the player picks a card. [CR]The current score is shown at the bottom of the screen.  The left digit appears to be the players score, while the right digit counts the number of rounds played.  When the player reaches 20 points they win the game and are returned to the main screen.  By setting the right difficulty switch to B, the player can activate the "Cheat" mode.  When the cheat mode is activated selecting any card will score the player points (thus making the game completely pointless).  When the switch is put back in A position the scoring is set back to normal (as normal as scoring gets in this game anyway).  The cheat mode was probably put in by the programmer to help the ESP challenged debug the game. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/mindmaze/mindmaze.htm[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Bounty Bob has tracked Yukon Yohan into Nuclear Ned's uranium mine. Bob must 'claim' each section of each part of the mine...but cannot take too long in each area, or the radiation will kill him.[CR]Taking the role of Bob, players must traverse through different types of areas inside the nuclear mine. In the first level, "Lift", Bob must walk on each part of the screen to 'claim' it. Avoid the monsters by jumping over them or grab an old miner possession to become energized and grab a mutant for points. Use the lift to reach the higher parts of the screen.[CR]The next area is the Crusher, with the same goal as Lift but more challenging as the player must also avoid getting crushed. The last part is the Radioactive Waste, where the goal is again the same, but the player must maneuver Bob around the radioactive waste. In each screen, there is a timer in the upper right. If this timer reached zero before you claim all sections, you lose a life.[CR]After you have beaten all three screens, they repeat but without any of the bonuses for energizing, so you must jump over or avoid all mutants.</plot>

				<title_clean>Mines of Minos</title_clean>
				<plot>You are the last mining robot on the Minos mine. Monsters have destroyed all your comrades.[CR]As the last robot, you must traverse the mine's various levels, gathering spare parts to make more robots (extra lives). You must either avoid the monsters or blow them up with a bomb. After a few seconds, if the monster hasn't hit the bomb, it will explode harmlessly. You can only drop one bomb at a time. If a monster is killed, it will regenerate somewhere in the maze.[CR]To deposit your spare parts, you must get to the center top or bottom of any level. To move to another level, hold your joystick button down while moving through the tunnels on either side. You can also use these tunnels, without holding down the button, to quickly get from left or right side of the maze to avoid monsters.[CR]To win the game, get to level five and ram each of the three stationary monsters to kill them. You will need at least two spare robots as the ramming will destroy you and the monster.[CR]In two player games, player one is the robot, player two is a monster. If the robot runs into the monster being controlled, the monster is destroyed instead of the robot. However, by pushing the joystick button, player two can switch to another monster, allowing the robot to run into an uncontrolled (and therefore deadly) monster.[CR]Difficulty switches[CR]Left switch for the robot, right for the monsters.[CR]Set to A to make half speed, B for normal speed.[CR]Game variations[CR]1P=one player[CR]2P=two player[CR]S=spare parts needed for spare robot[CR]F=mine levels flood, slowing you down if you enter the water.[CR]-T=cannot drop bombs in flooded areas[CR]+T=can drop bombs in flooded areas[CR]I-mines are invisible except when monsters are exploding by time bomb[CR]Game 1 1P; S=3; F-T[CR]Game 2 2P; S=3; F-T[CR]Game 3 1P; S=6; F-T[CR]Game 4 2P; S=6; F-T[CR]Game 5 1P; S=3[CR]Game 6 2P; S=3[CR]Game 7 1P; S=2; F-T[CR]Game 8 2P; S=2; F-T[CR]Game 9 1P; S=3; F+T[CR]Game 10 1P; S=3; F+T[CR]Game 11 1P; S=3; F+T; I[CR]Game 12 2P; S=3; F+T; I[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Destroy a monster=20 points[CR]Pick up robot part=70 points[CR]Deposit robot part=lose 70 points[CR]Every 1000 points scored up to 4000 raises your power level by one unit.</plot>

				<title_clean>Mines of Minos - Im Labyrinth der Roboter</title_clean>
				<plot>Something terrible has happened in the maze-like Mines of Minos. The smoothly running robot operation has been interrupted by an invasion of monstrous alien life forms! Aliens stalk the corridors of the mine; only a single robot survives to battle them. Desperately he struggles to find and assemble pieces of his fellow robots scattered around the mine while avoiding the pursuing aliens. If he can assemble a large enough robot army, he can battle the aliens to fight his way down to deeper levels of the mine and even destroy the alien command center at the lowest level. But if the aliens catch him he is doomed and his only weapon against them is his stock of time bombs.</plot>

				<title_clean>Miniature Golf</title_clean>
				<plot>This is a computer game simulation of a Miniature Golf course. It attempts to refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance.  As in a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the "cup."  Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated.[CR]Rather than a full 18 holes, this Miniature Golf variation has a nine-hole half-course.  Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the cup.  The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes.  While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it.  So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole.[CR]Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.</plot>

				<plot>Missile Control is a Missile Command-style game. The player has to defend their cities from incoming bombs fire by alien spaceships.[CR]The player controls a cursor on the screen which indicates the direction of fire for the defense missiles. Once launched, they travel in a straight line from the launcher through the point the player specified until they hit an object. Each level is won by destroying all alien spaceships. The player loses once all their cities are destroyed. Bonus cities can be obtained by destroying a sufficient number of alien spacecraft.[CR]The game gets progressively harder, for example bombs will fall faster and energy barriers might protect the aliens from the player's attacks. To get around the barriers, players can deflect their shots from large defense missiles launched at the sides of the screen.</plot>

				<plot>Motocross is a motorcycle racing game viewed from a top-down perspective. The player rides a bike against an endless number of opponents on a straight road, trying to avoid running into them. In addition, the player has to watch the amount of gas left in the tank. The fuel gauge can be restored by driving over fuel cans. The goal of the game is to overtake a specified amount of bikes. Once this is accomplished, a new "scene" starts, and the difficulty is increased.</plot>

				<plot>Bone-jarring off-road motorcycle racing in three events. You first must qualify in the Desert Scramble where you race across the desert avoiding the prickly cactus, desert creatures, rocks, etc., in a race of speed and time. Hit an object and your dirt bike slows down. Hit too many and you won't qualify for the next race. The Hill Climb is a torturous race up a switchback mountain full of obstacles. Speed is important but control is vital or you'll be out of the race. Qualify with a fast time and you're in the Beach Sprint against other qualifiers in an all-out dash for the championship.</plot>

				<plot>Motocross Racer is a bike racing game where you need to race through three different scenes in the shortest amount of time possible. Each scene takes place in a different location with a different perspective. First you will race through the desert with a 3-D behind the bike point of view. Rocks, cacti, scorpions, and other obstacles should be avoided or you'll crash and lose valuable time. Next you'll race a winding path uphill through the woods. This section has a top down view, and you'll lose time if you wander off the track or crash into obstacles. The final segment of the race takes place on the beach with a side scrolling point of view. Various obstacles and other racers will all get in your way here! If you crash too many times, or take too long the game will be over.</plot>

				<plot>Deep within a multi platformed diamond mine is a valuable crown. Your goal is to locate and retrieve the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Game Overview[CR]In Mr. Do, the player controls the aptly named title character - A Clown digging his way through a series Maze levels (similar to Boulderdash or Dig Dug), collecting cherries, whole avoiding or destroying the monsters roaming the tunnels. Mr. Do is capable of digging both horizontal and vertical tunnels. Apart from cherries, the levels also features apples. Apples cannot be collected but will rather fall down once Mr. Do digs sufficient room underneath. Ideally, the apples will squash monsters that mingle right beneath the apple. On the other hand, Mr. Do can also be eliminated when an apple happens to falls on him instead. Pushing the apples around horizontally can also help moving the same into position. Furthermore, Mr. Do can shoot a special "powerball" to eliminate enemies. However, the charge is limited to one shot and Mr. Do will have to wait until the ball bounces back to him until he can use the power again.[CR]The levels are cleared when all cherries are collected, all enemies killed, the five letters spelling E-X-T-R-A (Extra Life) or a diamond is found.[CR]Food[CR]There are many types of food that give you a varied amount of points and send out Pac-Man style ghost enemies that try to kill you! Here is a list of food:Sandwich Cake Milk Jug Egg Toast Bread Pie Hamburger Cheese Jello Waffle Chocolate[CR] [CR]Atari Version[CR]The Atari 2600 version was poorly rated for bad graphics and poor gameplay.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Mr. Do!'s Castle</title_clean>
				<plot>Mr. Do!'s Castle is an action platform game which has you in a castle consisting of several floors, each of which contain a variety of blocks. You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles. [CR]There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. [CR]The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.</plot>

				<title_clean>Night Driver</title_clean>
				<plot>The arcade version of Night Driver is one of the earliest first-person racing games ever made, though it was predated by the German arcade game Nurburgring from earlier in 1976.Gameplay[CR]The player controls a car, represented by a plastic underlay rather than a computer generated graphic, in a timed driving simulation. The arcade controls consist of a steering wheel, accelerator, and shift lever. Points accumulate as the play continues without crashing, and additional time is awarded at 300 points. The score counter resets at 1000, allowing the player additional time when 300 is achieved again. Difficulty settings affect the frequency and radius of the curves throughout play.The Atari 2600 version uses the paddle controllers, and feature color graphics, a rendered car, other vehicles to dodge, and various decorative features. There is no gear shift, so the car fully accelerates as the paddle button is depressed. Different modes of play include set tracks and a random track.The Commodore 64 version includes gear shifting, and a higher resolution graphic of the car, similar to the arcade's overlay.The use of reflective roadside markers helps suggest the illusion of gradual movement as the vehicle accelerates, cars in the opposing lane will honk as they are passed, and they show damage when crashed into.

				<title_clean>Night Stalker</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Night Stalker traps players in the middle of a cavernous                maze, with no hopes of escape. The objective is to last as long as possible while blasting as many enemies as possible using guns strewn throughout the maze. A steady "heartbeat" sound serves as the game's unique soundtrack amidst the sound of bullets.Night Stalker was released for the               Intellivision in 1982. It was ported to the              Atari 2600 (under the name Dark Cavern),             Apple II,            PC, and           Aquarius shortly afterwards.[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]Night Stalker was the first and only game created by Steve Montero as a lead programmer, and began development in 1981. While its frantic gameplay became an instant hit amongst other programmers at the office, the game's difficulty changed somewhat when a 12-year-old was allowed to playtest the game and outperformed everyone at          Mattel Electronics. The spider's unique ability of laying down player-slowing web was scrapped to make room for a more difficult enemy: the         invisible        robot.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The maze The player starts with six lives, and always       respawns in the middle of the maze, in the      bunker. Provided the player is completely inside the bunker, robots will be unable to kill the player (until 50,000 points, when the bunker's safety is threatened). A yellow gun will appear and flash somewhere in the maze, and it is up to the player to run out of the bunker and pick up the gun while dodging enemies. Once a gun has been picked up, the player can begin to fire at enemies. Each gun contains six bullets, and only one bullet from the player may be on the screen at any time. When all the bullets have been used, a new gun appears somewhere in the maze, and the process begins anew.The player can only die if shot by a robot. If this happens, the lives remaining will appear briefly in the lower left corner, the player respawns in the bunker, and a new gun is placed in the maze.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]At any given time, a maximum of four enemies will patrol the     maze: a spider, two support enemies, and the main    robot. Only robots can kill the player.Spider The Spider     The spider spawns in the web in the upper left corner, and moves randomly about the maze at a slow pace. The spider has a venomous bite, and will knock down and paralyze the player for a few seconds upon contact. The spider is easily killed with a single bullet, but it will respawn in the web shortly after its death. The spider is unaffected by robot fire.Bat Bat     The maze contains two vampire bats at the start of the game, which will awaken from the upper right corner of the maze and fly around randomly. The bats are rather quick, and will bite and paralyze the player for a few seconds upon contact, much like the spider. Their speed makes this paralysis slightly more dangerous, as a bat can move back and forth over a player and keep them paralyzed for an extended period of time, unable to move and susceptible to robot attack.Bats can be killed by a single bullet or robot fire, and when the score is under 5000, new bats will respawn to replace their fallen comrades. Once the score surpasses 5000, any killed bats remain dead permanently, and grey robots spawn to replace them.Grey Robot Grey Robot     The first robot the player encounters in the maze, spawning in the narrow passage in the lower left corner. It moves about slowly and randomly, firing at the player whenever it thinks it has a shot, and is easily killed by one bullet. Once the score reaches 5000, the grey robot will replace any slain bats, but no longer serves as the main robot adversary.Blue Robot Blue Robot     The blue robot appears at 5,000 points, replacing the original grey robot. It moves more intelligently than its predecessor, and will move more directly and aggressively towards the player. It is also killed with a single bullet.White Robot White Robot     The white robot replaces the blue robot at 15,000 points, and will also attempt to aggressively track down the player. The white robot is also much sturdier, and requires three bullets to kill. The first and second bullet hits will cause its shield to flash yellow.Black Robot Black Robot     At 30,000 points, the white robot steps aside for the black robot. The black robot moves quickly after the player, and also takes three bullets to kill. This is made even more difficult by the black robot's special white bullets, which will absorb any player bullets that come in contact with it, making crossfire shots worthless.At 50,000 points, the black robot's bullets are upgraded, and turn into yellow energy shots capable of destroying not only bullets, but the center bunker as well. If the black robot is allowed to shoot the bunker, there will be no constantly safe area for the player to hide for the remainder of the game.Invisible RobotIn the event the player reaches 80,000 points, the toughest robot comes out to play -- the invisible robot. The only way to determine this robot's exact location is through the bullets it fires; otherwise, it is virtually impossible to track.   The invisible robot is actually just a black robot colored blue to match the maze's background. Its shape is visible when it is hit the first and second time, and through some of the energy blasts it fires. Its behavior appears to match the black robot's, as well, and its energy blasts will also absorb bullets and destroy the bunker (if any pieces are remaining at this point).[CR][B]Strategy:[/B][CR]It is first important to remember that the   Intellivision cannot process input from the disc and numpad on one controller at the same time, making running and shooting at the same time difficult. However, if one controller is used to move, and the other to shoot, running and gunning is much easier. This two-controller technique is extremely handy for precision control in Night Stalker, where dodging robot fire is a necessity.Once the score surpasses 5,000 points, it is advisable to avoid shooting bats, to prevent additional robots from entering the maze. While the bat deaths are inevitable, leaving them alive makes the main robot more vulnerable and easy to target.Another important but often overlooked nuance: While the player can only have one bullet on the screen at a time, the robots also can only have one bullet on the screen at once, even if three robots are in play. This can be used for evading robots, as if a stray bullet is traveling down a long side corridor, the robots cannot harm the player as he runs about the maze. This technique can also be used to exploit and effectively " spawn camp" the robot entrance at the bottom. The grey and blue robots can be repeatedly killed by well-timed bullet as they slowly enter the maze. Later robots can be tricked into firing their bullet by the player peeking out around a nearby corner, and once the bullet passes by, the player can drop down and fire off quick shots to destroy the robot with ease.This act of dodging robot fire and returning fire becomes especially handy as the game progresses, most notably with the black robot's bullet-absorbing blasts.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Points are scored, unsurprisingly, by shooting enemies.Spiders: 100 pointsBats: 300 pointsGrey Robot: 300 pointsBlue Robot: 500 pointsWhite Robot: 1,000 pointsBlack Robot: 2,000 pointsInvisible Robot: 4,000 points Extra lives are earned every 10,000 points.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Jason has taken the Golden Fleece from the gods! They are naturally upset and have imprisoned Jason in the Temple of Aphrodite with deadly Furies running overhead. You control Jason and your goal is to eliminate all of the Furies to move on to the next level. The Furies can be destroyed if they are hit with a magical brick from the roof of the temple. You are armed with an unlimited supply of stones, throwing a stone at the roof will cause a brick to  fall (be careful, you'll lose a life if you hit yourself with a falling brick instead of the Furies). When a Fury is hit by a brick it is destroyed, but if you accidentally hit a Fury with a stone then it will multiply! The Furies will also be firing at you, and if you'll lose a life if hit. The game ends when you have no more lives left in reserve. Several difficulty levels are available.</plot>

In any case, he needs some good ol' magic potion from Getafix in order to defeat the "red" Romans, so be ready to catch some when Getafix comes knocking.[CR]There are 2 types of Roman soldiers to thump: the fat legionnaires and the small centurions. Centurions are worth more points.</plot>

				<title_clean>Off the Wall</title_clean>
				<plot>Some say that the legend of grand master Kung Fu Lu is centuries old. It begins soon after the Great Wall of China was erected. Near the new wall stood an old, ugly wall in which spirits lived. The people wanted to tear the evil wall down, but were afraid. Kung Fu Lu was a young lad then who had been granted five lives. One day a mystical dragon appeared on the old wall and threw a ball directly at him. Lu swung his walking stick and smashed the ball back. Bricks shattered and magical objects bearing good fortune and special powers fell from the Wall. Kung Fu Lu tried to catch as many as he could. Lu discovered that the battle for wealth and fortune has a very costly price. If he missed the ball with his stick, he lost one of his lives. And guarding the Wall was a cunning blackbird whose task was to prevent Kung Fu Lu from smashing the bricks. Patient Lu tried again and again to shatter the bricks. Persistence pays and eventually he became skillful in destroying the brick wall. He moved through all four difficult challenges to gain the honorable position of Master. The legend tells us only those who have fortitude and determination can ever match the brilliance of Grand Master Kung Fu Lu.Are you one of the chosen?</plot>

				<title_clean>Oink!</title_clean>
				<plot>Oink! is based on the fairy tale of the three little pigs. The big bad wolf is trying to blow down each of the pigs houses. You control each pig one at a time. The wolf is at the bottom of the screen and will blow a hole in the house one section at a time. Each time a hole is formed, the pig must patch it up quickly so the wolf can't get in. New materials are located at the top of the screen, and you need to grab them and place them in the holes as they are formed. The longer you last, the tougher the wolf will become! You start the game controlling the pig whose house is made of straw; when he is caught, you move on to the pig in the house made of sticks. Finally you will control the pig in the house made of bricks. When all three pigs have been caught by the wolf, the game is over.</plot>

				<title_clean>Omega Race</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR]Many people outside of the US will have not played Omega Race in the arcade, or even known it had an arcade release.  On home machines it had greater exposure, and is often regarded as a quality game. The original arcade graphics were black and white vectors, in a style consistent with Atari's Asteroids.  Console releases added some color, apart from the VIC-20 version. The aim of the game was simple; your triangular ship was tasked with destroying a variety of enemy ships in a rectangular race-track style space.  Enemy drones simply moved in formation, while activated enemies could return fire.  The levels got progressively harder as you played, with more drones becoming active at a time.  One unique feature was the controls.   In the arcade version, the direction was controled by a spinner.  On the VIC-20, using a  control stick and buttons, the ship's thrusters were based on how long you pushed on the stick which thus determined your speed and was very tricky to control.  The Atari 2600 version featured a separate controller adapter with two action buttons, in an attempt to compensate for the single action button on the standard joystick controller.   As with Asteroids, the player's ship had inertia, with the additional feature of walls on the inside and outside of the track that would cause the ship to bounce.  Player death would occur either when shot by an active enemy, or upon collision with an enemy unit.  As each wave of enemies are defeated, a new race begins. The VIC-20 release of the game was notable for being a rear-loading cartridge game, allowing for extremely fast loading times compared to the cassette tape games on the system.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Open Sesame</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Open, Sesame! or Sesam, &#214;ffne Dich is a European exclusive Atari 2600 game developed and published by Bit Corporation in 1983.  It is a very simple platformer that is only truly notable for being the second and final Atari 2600 game to feature voice synthesis; the first being Quadrun.  The game features Ali Baba climbing to the top of the screen to get the "treasure" which is pictured as a giant crown, which upon reaching he says "Open, Sesame!" and the game begins anew.  While the game is rather obscure, it saw a few re-releases and had various versions so it is not very rare or expensive.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Open, Sesame! is single screen platformer featuring 5 horizontal levels the player, Ali Baba, walks across as well as a top platform featuring the goal, a crown.  Ali Baba travels on each platform to 2 blinking dots and activates them to extend a ladder to the next platform.  Every ladder in the level must be activated for Ali Baba to be able to reach the crown at the top.  A bonus dot occasionally spawns and starts to travel down the platforms, which gives the player extra points if it is touched.  The metal bar appearance of the platforms, game layout, and use of ladders is uncoincidentally reminiscent of Donkey Kong.  The four middle platforms in the game are patrolled by one enemy each, which simply walk slowly towards Ali Baba when he reaches that level.  If the player is in the middle of a ladder, they are unable to be touched by the enemies and the enemies ignore the player.  If an enemy touches Ali Baba, he falls off the platform to the bottom, loses a life, and starts over but the activated ladders do not reset.  A bonus meter slowly ticks down at the top of the screen indicating how many points the player will get for completing that level, and when it reaches zero the player is killed as if an enemy touched him.  Each stage gets progressively harder as the enemies move faster.Voice SynthesisWhat makes the rather average Open, Sesame! stand out is that it featured a voice synthesized "Open, Sesame!" at the beginning of each stage and when the game boots up.  This synthesis came after the popular Quadrun's synthesis but is technically more impressive, packing nearly a second of sound into 848 bytes.  Even with better compression and a longer soundclip, perhaps most impressive was the fact that a colorful crown is displayed on the screen while the voice clip plays.  Quadrun's voice synthesis took up all the 2600's available memory, so the screen had to be blanked out.  Unfortunately, the voice clip is barely recognizable as "Open, Sesame!" and sounds very muffled.  Without knowing the name or premise of the game, it would be very difficult to distinguish what is being said.  Quadrun's voice was somewhat distinct.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Out of Control</title_clean>
				<plot>This is an obstacle race in a space ship. The ship controls in a rather Asteroids-like way, in that you push left or right to rotate and press fire to thrust. Once you stop thrusting, the ship does not immediately stop, although it will slow down on its own. To stop sooner, you have to face away from the direction you are traveling and thrust.[CR]First, you must pass a set number of hurdles. If there is a single hurdle, you must pass on the side indicated by the arrow. If there are two hurdles, you must pass in between them. If there are three, you can pass through them or go around. If you hit a hurdle, you must go back to the last successfully passed hurdle and do it again to continue.[CR]After the hurdles, you must pop ten space balloons by running in to them. They appear one at a time at random spots on the screen. After you pop all ten balloons, you must dock in the space dock to end the race.[CR]The difficulty switches are not used. You select your game variation by moving the joystick up or down.[CR]Game variations[CR]There are 28 variations. The odd numbered ones have fast maneuvering, the even numbered ones, slow.[CR]The number of hurdles also varies. The first two have 10 hurdles, the next two, 14, then 22 (twice), 27 (twice), 35 (twice), 39 (four times), 47 (twice), 51 (twice), 54 (twice), 63 (twice), 64 (twice), 72 (twice), and 82 (twice).</plot>

				<title_clean>Outlaw</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A dueling game where two desperadoes try to lay each other flat in a gun battle, similar to the 1975 arcade game, Gun Fight.Gameplay[CR]There are several types of obstacles in Outlaw; they fall into three basic categories:Cacti, the stage coach, and the wall obstacles.There is destructible terrain, which disappears a square at a time with each hit, and there's solid terrain that is undamaged by attacks.There is moving terrain which continues upward, but retains damage given.There are several combinations of these different elements, although some of the combinations are left out (a moving cactus is a bit too absurd, a solid wall would prevent both sides from ever hitting each other). Another element is that weapons can have limited ammunition. After six bullets are fired, players may only receive a new six bullets after the other player has expended their ammunition. Finally, there is an option to force a shooting player to remain still until his or her bullet has left the play area, thus leaving them vulnerable once they've made an attempt on the opponent's life.In addition to two player, there is also a target practice mode, where a moving target rapidly bounces from the top to the bottom of the screen and back. Players have a limited amount of time to hit the target a set number of times.There is a possibility that the game stagnates, where neither player is willing to expose him or herself to opponent's fire. It's recommended by this contributor that destructible terrain is used to help reduce this tendency.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Pac-Kong</title_clean>
				<plot>Pac-Kong plays very similar to Donkey Kong. The player controls an "adventurer" (called Kong in some versions of the game) and has to reach the treasures the evil octopus hid away.[CR]Each level consists of a series of platforms that are interconnected by ladders. The only action the player can take besides moving around is pressing fire to make the hero jump. This is necessary to get across the gaps between some of the platforms. At the same time, the player has to avoid the smaller octopi as well as clouds of poison gas which move around the screen randomly. Once the player reaches one of the treasure chests at the top of the screen they won the level and a new round starts.[CR]Pac-Kong can also be played by two players in an alternating fashion.</plot>

				<title_clean>Pac-Man</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An important icon of arcade gamingOriginally titled Puck Man, Pac-Man hit the arcade scene first in Japan when Namco released it on May 22, 1980. Shortly after receiving a lukewarm response, the game was released in the U.S. by Midway. Compared to other arcade hits in the early '80s, such as Space Invaders, Galaxian, Defender, and Asteroids, Pac-Man put a friendlier face on its bizarre action and thus had the ability to appeal to a much broader audience. Toru Iwatani has said that he was looking for a way to attract women into arcades, which at the time were almost exclusively male locations. Having discarded ideas for a fashion based game and a love simulator, he had a eureka moment after a meal with his girlfriend. He noticed she ate a lot of dessert. Iwatani realized then that eating was a universal concept which he could exploit in a game.The game was considered a smash hit in the U.S. and spawned many sequels and spin-offs, including an animated television show (known as Pac-Man: The Animated Series), a breakfast cereal, and the song Pac-Man Fever by Buckner &amp; Garcia. Not to mention NFL star, Adam "Pac-Man" Jones, and eight-weight boxing champion, Manny "Pac-Man" Pacquaio.The original Pac-Man game was ported to various systems, including the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, NES, PC, Apple II, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Gear, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit, Intellivision, MSX, NEC PC-6001, NEC PC-8801, FM-7, Sharp X1, Commodore VIC-20, ZX Spectrum, Neo Geo Pocket Color, mobile phones, iPhone, and iPod. The game was also released as an Xbox Live Arcade game under the Xbox Live Marketplace. That version was also included in the compilation disc Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade. The NES version was also re-released for the Game Boy Advance under its Classic NES Series program and for the Nintendo Wii in its Wii Virtual Console platform. The arcade version was re-released as a secret game under the Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga 20 Year Reunion cabinet (in the game selection screen, move the joystick up, up, up, down, down, down, left, right, left, right, left, and press both start buttons before inserting tokens). In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Pac-Man the cabinet was re-released with Pac-Man freely playable. The arcade version was also bundled with compilation discs such as Microsoft Return of Arcade, Microsoft Return of Arcade Anniversary Edition, Namco Museum Vol. 1 for the PlayStation, Namco Museum 64 for the Nintendo 64, Namco Museum for the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, Namco Museum DS for the Nintendo DS, Namco Museum Battle Collection for the PSP, and Namco Museum Essentials for the PlayStation Network (PS3).The infamous 2600 port of Pac-ManThe Atari 2600 port is infamous for being considered one of the worst video games ever created. Having a very short development time frame and a very small staff, Pac-Man for 2600 wound up being a failed attempt at bringing an arcade classic home. Alongside E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, it can be considered a major factor in the collapse of Atari, Inc. as well as the Video Game Crash of 1983. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-ManThe basic premise of the game involves the character, Pac-Man, a yellow circle with a slice cut out for a mouth. It's said by developer Toru Iwatani to represent a pizza with one missing slice as well as the general idea of a mouth eating. The player controls Pac-Man through a seemingly-endless amount of mazes, collecting pellets (or "dots") for points while avoiding the four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde, each with their own unique movement patterns). If the player runs into any of the ghosts, the player loses a life. However, the player can run into a power pellet, which make the ghosts temporarily edible for points. This ability, which most players would consider fundamental to Pac-Man, was absent from the game until mid-way through development as Toru Iwatani and his team were fed up being constantly chased and decided to turn the tables on the ghosts.Players can also get bonus fruit pieces which show up at random intervals in each level. The primary goal is to maneuver around the level and eat up all the pellets without losing lives.Veterans of this game noticed patterns about the four ghosts and have developed movement patterns for each level that guarantee success. While hypothetically there is no ending to this game, level 256 is considered a kill screen. A bug in the routine on level 256 eliminates most of the pellets on the right side of the screen, replacing them and the maze with garbled text and graphics. It is impossible to clear that level legitimately. Because this level marks an end-point, the game can have a "perfect play" where the player achieves the maximum possible score on the first 255 levels without losing a single life and then scoring as many points as possible on the kill screen before losing all his lives. The maximum score possible in this game is 3,333,360 points. The first person to achieve this score was Billy Mitchell on July 3, 1999.[CR]Development[CR]The game was developed primarily by a young Namco employee named T&#333;ru Iwatani over the course of a year, beginning in April 1979, employing a nine-man team. It was based on the concept of eating, and the original Japanese title was Pakkuman (&#12497;&#12483;&#12463;&#12510;&#12531;), inspired by the Japanese onomatopoeic slang phrase paku-paku taberu (&#12497;&#12463;&#12497;&#12463;&#39135;&#12409;&#12427;), where paku-paku describes (the sound of) the mouth movement when widely opened and then closed in succession.Although Iwatani has repeatedly stated that the character's shape was inspired by a pizza missing a slice, he admitted in a 1986 interview that this was a half-truth and the character design also came from simplifying and rounding out the Japanese character for mouth, kuchi (&#21475;). Iwatani attempted to appeal to a wider audience&#8212;beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time. This led him to add elements of a maze, as well as cute monster enemy characters. Eating to gain power, Iwatani has said, was a concept he borrowed from Popeye. The result was a game he named Puck Man as a reference to the main character's hockey puck shape.Later in 1980, the game was picked up for manufacture in the United States by Bally division Midway, which changed the game's name from Puck Man to Pac-Man in an effort to avoid vandalism. The cabinet artwork was also changed and the pace and level of difficulty increased to appeal to Western audiences.[CR]Impact and Legacy[CR]Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games, and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Upon its release, the game &#8211; and subsequent Pac-Man derivatives &#8211; became a social phenomenon that sold a large amount of merchandise and also inspired, among other things, an animated television series and a top-ten hit single.When Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were space shooters, Space Invaders being the most popular. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivatives of Pong. Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre and appealing to both genders. Pac-Man is often credited with being a landmark in video game history, and is among the most famous arcade games of all time. It is also one of the highest-grossing video games of all time, having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s.When first launched in Japan by Namco in 1980, the game received a lukewarm response, as Space Invaders and other similar games were more popular at the time. However, the game found far more success in North America. Pac-Man&#8202;'&#8203;s success in North America took competitors and distributors completely by surprise in 1980. Marketing executives who saw Pac-Man at a trade show prior to release completely overlooked the game (along with the now classic Defender), while they looked to a racing car game called Rally-X as the game to outdo that year. The appeal of Pac-Man was such that the game caught on immediately with the public; it quickly became far more popular than anything seen in the game industry up to that point. Pac-Man outstripped Asteroids as the best-selling arcade game in North America, grossing over $1 billion in quarters in its first year, surpassing the revenues grossed by the highest-grossing filmStar Wars.It sold more than 350,000 arcade cabinets (retailing at around $2400 each) for $1 billion within 18 months (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). By 1982, the game had sold 400,000 arcade machines worldwide and an estimated 7 billion coins had been inserted into Pac-Man machines. In addition, United States revenues from Pac-Man licensed products (games, T-shirts, pop songs, wastepaper baskets, etc.) exceeded $1 billion (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). The game was also estimated to have had 30 million active players across the United States in 1982.Towards the end of the 20th century, the game's total gross in quarters had been estimated by Twin Galaxies at more than 10 billion quarters ($2.5 billion), making it the highest-grossing video game of all time (inflation adjusted: $7.16 billion in 2014). In January 1982, the game won the overall Best Commercial Arcade Game award at the 1981 Arcade Awards. In 2001, it was voted the greatest video game of all time by a Dixons poll in the UK.The game is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for a number of reasons: its titular character was the first original gaming mascot, the game established the maze chase game genre, it demonstrated the potential of characters in video games, it opened gaming to female audiences, and it was gaming's first licensing success. In addition, it was the first video game to feature power-ups, and it is frequently credited as the first game to feature cut scenes, in the form of brief comical interludes about Pac-Man and the monsters chasing each other around during those interludes, though Space Invaders Part II employed a similar technique slightly earlier. Pac-Man is also credited for laying the foundations for the stealth game genre, as it emphasized avoiding enemies rather than fighting them, and had an influence on the early stealth game Metal Gear, where guards chase Solid Snake in a similar manner to Pac-Man when he is spotted.Pac-Man has also influenced many other games, ranging from the open-world sandbox game Grand Theft Auto (where the player runs over pedestrians and gets chased by police in a similar manner) to early first-person shooters such as MIDI Maze (which had similar maze-based gameplay and character designs). Game designer John Romero credited Pac-Man as the game that had the biggest influence on his career; Wolfenstein 3D was similar in level design and featured a Pac-Man level from a first-person perspective, while Doom had a similar emphasis on mazes, power-ups, killing monsters, and reaching the next level.

				<plot>This is one of the more interesting Atari collectibles. Coco-Cola commissioned a game from Atari to give to their Atlanta employees. In this case, Atari redesigned Space Invaders so that you shoot the letters "P E P S I" instead of space creatures. There were 125 copies of this game made. There is no real box for this one, just a flimsy Styrofoam shell. So it isn't really a prototype, but it wasn't a commercially available game either. And no, Coca-Cola does not have any copies left.[CR]http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=850[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Pick 'n' Pile</title_clean>
				<plot>Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.[CR]In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</plot>

				<plot>OK, here's the deal. If you want that lover of your dreams to get off their pedestal and go out with you, you need to present them with the right gifts. Then you can head over to the Love Nest Hotel to really score![CR]You start with your lover of a pedestal on the left and various items floating above you. You must shoot each item once to acquire it. If an item starts flashing, shoot it next because after a short time, you'll lose a chance. If you shoot an item a second time, you will lose it and a chance. Lose all your chances and the game is over. If you collect all the items needed, head over to the pedestal then head off the screen to the right. Head to the door of the hotel and the hotel sign will say how many times you have scored. Now head left to start the next level.</plot>

				<plot>You are out enjoying a picnic, when suddenly a swarm of flies arrive! You control a fly swatter at the bottom of the screen; your goal in this game is to protect your hamburgers (located on the left and right bottom of the screen) from the attacking flies. When a fly is close enough, it will stick out its tongue to eat the food. If you can swat the fly right when it has its tongue out, it will be knocked out and fall into your fly trap. When all of the flies have been knocked into the trap, you will then need to face a large super fly before the level is complete (be careful, it can eat your food fast!) After knocking out the super fly, you move on to the next round. The game ends when all of your hamburgers have been completely eaten.</plot>

				<title_clean>Piece o' Cake</title_clean>
				<plot>In Piece o' Cake you are a chef, and your goal is to successfully build cakes! At the bottom of the screen is a conveyor belt, and a platter will appear at the left side moving towards the right. You are at the top of the screen, and need to take cake layers from the oven and drop them onto the platter. The cake layers are different sizes, and you must drop them such that each layer is the same size or smaller than the one beneath it. After you have created a cake, you need to top it off with a cherry. If you are unable to successfully create a cake with the layers in the proper order and a topped with a cherry before the platter reaches the right side of the screen, it will fall off the conveyor and you lose a life. The different size cake layers come out of the oven randomly, so if you get a size you don't want it can be dropped off at the right side of the screen until a layer you do want appears. Although you can build cakes of different sizes, bonus points are earned for building a perfect cake consisting of one large layer, one medium layer, one small layer, and a cherry. As the game progresses, the conveyor will pick up speed to make cake building tougher.</plot>

				<title_clean>Planet of the Apes</title_clean>
				<plot>Talk about suffering from an identity crisis, for years Planet of the Ape had been misidentified as another 20th Century Fox prototype called Alligator People.  This was because the first PotA prototype was found in case labeled Alligator People, and since no screenshots of either game existed there was no reason to doubt the name on the label.  However after much research it was discovered (by yours truly) that this game was in fact really John Marvin's lost Planet of the Apes game.  So why was Planet of the Apes found in a case labeled Alligator People?  While no one knows for sure, it's assumed that this prototype was simply put into the wrong case (they probably just used an old case they had lying around).  [CR]You play the role Col. George Taylor (who looks a bit like Pitfall Harry's long lost brother).  Your mission is to guide Col. Taylor through a series of screens as he avoids an army of apes and makes his way towards the Forbidden Zone.  There are three different kinds of apes in this game, and they all move in a straight line across the screen from right to left.[CR]Chimpanzees - These little guys are harmless and can be touched without fear.  Shooting them is worth 3 points.[CR]Orangutans - Orangutans are a bit bigger and a lot more dangerous than the Chimpanzees.  Touching them will get you captured and cost you 1 life unit.  Shooting a Chimpanzee is worth 200 points.  [CR]Gorillas - Gorillas are the most dangerous of all the apes.  Not only can they capture you, but they can shoot at you as well.  Being shot will cost you 2 life units and shooting them is worth only 42 points![CR]At the top of the screen you see two counters, L and E.  L is your Life counter, you start with 60 life points and if you lose them all the game ends.  The E is your Escape counter, this is the number of times you can escape from the cage or pit.  If you run out of escapes your character will be trapped forever (effectively ending the game).[CR]The Forest[CR]You start out in a forest with several apes after you.  You can shoot at the apes by pressing the fire button, but since they just keep on coming its best to run for it.  There are also pits scattered throughout the forest, falling into one of these pits will cause your life to deplete rapidly.  Thankfully you can press the fire button to get out, but it will cost you one of your Escapes.  While you can run in any direction, only moving south will advance you towards your goal.  Moving south three times will bring you to the river.   [CR]The River[CR]Unlike other sections of this game, the river is only one screen wide.  Once again you can move any direction, but only going south will bring you towards the Forbidden Zone.  Touching the river isn't deadly, and you can move through without any trouble.  As you move through the river you'll notice that your guy appears to be flailing about with his arms in the air like he's drowning.  This may be because the river was going to be deadly and a bridge put across it, but since this is an early prototype we'll assume your guy is just a poor swimmer and move on.[CR]The Village[CR]If you touched an Orangutan or a Gorilla then you'll end up here.  You can escape from the cage by pressing the fire button, but it will cost you one of your Escapes.  You need to be extra careful in the village since the area is cramped, and there are lots of apes roaming around.  It's very easy to escape and be captured again right away.  You'll also want to escape from the cage as quickly as possible since the apes will constantly hit you while your trapped in the cage.  Moving south three times will bring you to the desert.[CR]The Desert[CR]After the river you'll encounter a large featureless desert which is the beginning of the Forbidden Zone.  There are more apes here than in any other part of the game, so you'll have to be on your guard.  Each desert board looks exactly alike except for a slight change in color, so its easy to get lost.  If you haven't been caught, moving south nine times will bring you to the caverns.  If you came by way of the village (you were captured), you only need to move south six times to reach the caves.[CR]The Caverns[CR]These have to be the funkiest looking caverns I've ever seen.  The cavern walls are rainbow colored making your journey extra trippy.  There are no apes to worry about in the caverns, but they are unfortunately a giant maze.  You'll also slowly loose life points as you traverse the caves at the rate of 1 point every 5 seconds.  There are two paths out of the caves: If you got captured at least once you to move south once, left once, and south again, but if you took the long way you need to move south once, left once, and south twice to reach your goal.  If you take the wrong path through the caves you'll end up back on the forest screen.  There are other paths out of the caves, but these work every time.[CR]The Statue of Liberty[CR]This is the goal you've been trying to reach.  It's a little hard to make out, but the picture is of the Statue of Liberty's torch and head.  Once you reach this the screen will begin to flash and you'll see the Statue of Liberty displayed while the background scrolls through all the boards you've crossed.  After this strange scene you'll gain 10 life points, 1 extra Escape, and 1200 bonus points.  You will now start back at the forest screen on the next higher difficulty level. [CR]Each new difficulty level has a few changes:[CR]The apes will do an extra point of damage when they shoot you.[CR]The apes move faster.[CR]More apes appear on the screen at once and come out more often.[CR]The bonus points for reaching the Statue of Liberty increases by 100.[CR]It's obvious that Planet of the Apes still has some work to be done, but was finished enough to go through initial playtesting.  Before programmer John Marvin could finish it he left 20th Century Fox to go work for Epyx.  Since 20th Century Fox closed down its video game unit three months later Planet of the Apes was never completed.

Initially, you must shoot the oncoming lager, red ships but avoid the smaller, blue missiles. Do not shoot the black ship. Dock with it so you can land and refuel later. When you come to the three enemy fuel depots, shoot each one to destroy it then make your way through a mine field to continue. If you come to the landing strip, just align your ship with it to land and a refueling truck will top off your tanks. As you move into night, the enemy ships become too dark to see. You can then create light, temporarily, by firing off shots.</plot>

				<plot>This is a sequel to Phoenix. [CR]On the first screen, you must shoot swooping aliens while not getting shot by them. At some point, an alien will create a shield across the screen just above your ship that will require you to shoot holes through to destroy more aliens. Be aware, however, that the alien shots are not slowed at all and can still kill you.[CR]On the second screen, you must shoot or avoid a phoenix(es) shots but the object is to shoot the alien in  the mothership above. You can also shoot the phoenix(es) themselves for points.[CR]On the third screen, you must maneuver between parked ships, without hitting any, to dock at your spot at the top. Once you do this, the game goes to the first screen only harder.[CR]There are game selections to choose to also play only the first, second or third screens, with each wave getting harder.</plot>

				<title_clean>Polo</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Programmed by Carol Shaw, Polo is a game for the Atari 2600 based on the sport of the same name. It was originally designed to be a tie-in for Ralph Lauren's Polo cologne. The plan was to have the game set up on Atari 2600 consoles that were located within New York City's Bloomingdale's department store. However, the promotion never ended up seeing the light of day, and thus, the game was shelved.Despite this, a version of the game's prototype was released on the compilation disc, 'Stella Gets a New Brain' in 1996. As well as this, a standalone version of the game was released in 2002 by Cassidy Nolen during the PhillyClassic 3 game convention.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Pompeii</title_clean>
				<plot>Pompeii was one of the last titles announced by Apollo, but went unreleased when Apollo became one of the first 2600 game companies to fold in the wake of the crash.  From box art and a few brief descriptions we can surmise that the game revolved around an Indiana Jones like archaeologist who is trying to find treasures in the ruins of the ancient city of Pompeii.  For those who aren't up on your ancient History; Pompeii was an ancient Roman city at the base of the volcano Mt. Vesuvius which was destroyed when the volcano erupted in 79 AD.  Since the eruption caught the people off guard everything in the city was covered in volcanic ash, this makes the ruins a treasure trove for archaeologists because all city and its contents were protected from the elements over the centuries by the very ash that killed them.  How's that for irony?[CR]Unfortunately the only prototype that's surfaced so far is very incomplete.  The background graphics are very well done and depict a smoldering volcano (Mt. Vesuvius) and two strange shapes on either side (treasures?).  Your character hardly looks anything like the Indiana Jones character depicted on the box, but since this is a prototype he may have been "Indyized" in later versions.  Your character does have some slight walking animation, but it's far too slow for how quickly he moves.  The brown columns on the playfield are really place holders for enemy creatures which had yet to be defined.[CR]This prototype is little more than a movement demo.  Your character can walk around the bottom half of the screen, but if he gets to close to the top his head becomes truncated (an obvious programming glitch).  When your character walks over the column placeholders, a number (from 1 to 47) is displayed in hexadecimal notation in the lower right of the screen.  Pushing the left controller button will also make a hexadecimal number appear in the lower right corner (from 47 to 8E).  These numbers may have something to do scanline you're currently on, and were probably used to check collisions between your character and the lava or enemy creatures. [CR]You can make the lava level rise by pressing the right controller button.  The lava pool can extend all the way to the middle of the screen, but once you start raising the lava level there's no way to bring it back down.  As usual, the lava has no affect on your player and he can safely stand in it all day.  Beyond the excitement of walking around and watching the lava rise, there isn't anything else to do in this prototype. [CR]Its hard to judge a game based on such an early prototype, but from what's been implemented Pompeii was looking pretty good.  After several mediocre titles Apollo may have actually had a decent chance with this game, but the crash wouldn't wait for them to prove themselves.  Supposedly there was a finished version of the game that was ready to be ported to the Atari 800, but this rumor hasn't been verified.

				<title_clean>Popeye</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Popeye must catch hearts, musical notes, or letter from the word "HELP" that his girlfriend Olive Oyl, who is located at the top of the screen, is tossing down. These items slowly floating items descend to the bottom of the screen and eventually 'break' unless Popeye can collect them.[CR]Popeye's nemesis, Bluto, pursues him throughout each of the repeating three stages. The Sea Hag also appears to hurl bottles, etc. at our hero. Sweet Pea and Wimpy also make appearances but only serve to provide opportunities to score more points.[CR]The three stages consist of the dock level, the street level, and the ship level. Difficulty increases each time the player completes the set of stages. Controls consist of an 8-way joystick and a 'punch' button.[CR]History &amp; Design[CR] Original Arcade Cabinet[CR]Popeye was released by Nintendo in 1982. Its cabinet is the same design as the earlier more recognizable Donkey Kong and the later Donkey Kong Jr. cabinets. A cocktail table version was also released. The game was designed by Genyo Takeda and a young upstart designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. The Popeye characters were originally going to be used for Donkey Kong, but Nintendo decided to go with an original character creation that evolved into the iconic Mario. The CPU was a Z80 Chip running at 4MHz. Sound was produced using a AY8910 chip running at 2MHz.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Three Stages of Popeye[CR]THE DOCK STAGE - Popeye must catch 24 hearts that Olive Oyl tosses down one at a time. The HUD displays how many hearts the player has collected. If a heart reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will lose a life if he doesn't retrieve the breaking heart after about 10 seconds.[CR]Bluto chases Popeye throughout the stage. There are two ways he can be temporarily disposed of. One is by punching the signature can of spinach that will periodically appear on the sides of the screen. Once the can is punched, Popeye gets stong and turns red for about 10 seconds and has the ability to punch Bluto, sending him bouncing across the screen and into the sea. Catching hearts while in this 'red mode' will also net double points. The player will get 3000 points knocking out Bluto but he will shortly climb back out and continue his pursuit. The second way he can be incapacitated is by hitting a punching bag that dislodges a bucket. If timed right, the bucket will fall on Bluto's head giving the player 2000 points and some time to grabs some more hearts before he eventually pulls the bucket off.[CR]Both Bluto and the Sea Hag like to throw bottles at Popeye. These bottles can be broken by punching them. Bluto throws his bottles in groups of four and the Sea Hag will periodically show up on the side of the screen, throw one and disappear. Sometimes there will will be one on each side and they'll simultaneously throw a bottle, attempting to 'sandwich' Popeye between them is he isn't fast enough with his punches. Bluto can also jump up to a higher level or reach down to a lower level to knock Popeye out. Players should take caution when passing Bluto directly above or below him.[CR]THE STREET STAGE - This stage is similar to the first but features a different level layout and Olive throws musical notes instead of hearts. There is also a seesaw located in the lower left corner that, if timed right, allows Popeye to be launched in the air, thanks to Wimpy standing on the other end. Once in the air, Popeye can touch Sweet Pea for a point bonus who is floating above with a balloon.[CR]THE SHIP STAGE - The final stage features similar gameplay with two different features. One is there is a sliding platform at the top. Second each time Popeye catches one of the H-E-L-P letters that Olive tosses him, a ladder step will appear. Once enough letters are caught and the ladder is completed, Popeye can climb up and rescue Olive. The Sea Hag's pet vulture will also come out on the left side of the screen. Popeye can punch it continuously for points.[CR]Once Popeye rescues Olive, players are treated to a short intermission where Popeye's theme song is played while his face appears on the screen, blowing his signature "toot, toot" on his pipe. Players are then returned to the first stage again with increased difficulty. The Sea Hag now send bouncing skulls at Popeye, which are more difficult to punch. They will also fall down from an above level and knock him on the head if he is walking directly below.[CR]Ports[CR]Popeye was ported to several popular home consoles in subsequent years including the Atari 2600 and 5200, Intellivision, Colecovision, Odyssey2, and eventually came full circle releasing on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Ports to computer systems included the Texas Instruments TI-99, Atari XL, and Commodore 64. A mobile phone version was also released in 2008.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra points[CR]Collect over eight hearts, then intentionally lose a life. As soon as game play resumes, move to the right and collect the spinach located off the ledge. Quickly hit Bluto to increase your score to over 140,000 points. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra points[CR]Hold Reset during game play to play the music at a lower range.</plot>

				<plot>Q*Bert's Qubes is the sequel to the game Q*Bert and features similar gameplay, but is now in three dimensions. Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.</plot>

				<title_clean>Quest for Quintana Roo</title_clean>
				<plot>You are Yucatan Sam on a quest to explore the temple of Quintana Roo. Your goal is to find the vault which is hidden somewhere within and return with the treasure that is inside. You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Players control a kangaroo or squirrel in Quick Step, an jumping action game from Imagic.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Player one controls a kangaroo, while the squirrel is controlled by another player, or a computerized opponent. The object of the game is to score the most points before losing every life.[CR]The playfield consists of multiple "trampolines"; bars of color which can be jumped on by either player. A grey trampoline scores no points, a pink one scores five. Additionally, jumping on a pink trampoline turns it to the player's color. Players continue jumping on to trampolines, turning them their respective color, until an alarm signals the end of a stage. At this point, the next screen scrolls down vertically, and trampolines score points as they scroll off the bottom of the screen. It is therefore the object to end the stage with as many trampolines as possible turned to the respective colors of the players.[CR]Additionally, there are "tricky trap" trampolines (6 in total) where a player can use the lone button on the atari joystick to remove a trampoline altogether. The disappearing trampoline would be the one most recently jumped on. A magic hat is occasionally up for grabs as well. capturing the hat and touching an opponent while on a trampoline causes that opponent to temporarily freeze, giving an advantage to the player with the hat. Gold mats are worth additional points, and award one additional tricky trap for a maximum of 7.[CR]Each player has 6 lives, with a bonus life at 2000 points. The surviving player gains 200 points per remaining life (and is awarded a bonus life if the remaining life bonus puts that player over 2000).[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You are a rabbit who is just trying to get to where you can get a mate and make like a mathematician by multiplying. First you must get through the meadow and across the ledges without losing life and limb.[CR]You start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game start back at the beginning only harder.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Radar Lock is an After Burner style air-to-air combat game for the Atari 2600. Programmer Doug Neubauer reused the Solaris engine to speed up development. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Two joysticks are used whether playing the single- or two-player mode. In single-player mode, the left joystick controls movement and the button fires the currently selected weapon. The right joystick is used to select one of three weapons, and the fire button fires the afterburner to speed up the jet while held. The two-player mode is similar, but the button functions are swapped so that player one flys the plane, and player two selects and fires the weapons. Machine Gun: The player begins with 2550 rounds of ammunition. Machine gun fire will destroy all targets, but the larger bombers and fighters absorb a good deal of machine gun fire.Guided Missiles: Guided missiles will cause heavy damage to any aircraft after a successful lock.Proximity Missiles: Proximity missiles will destroy all enemies except for bombers and stealth fighters, which are currently in view.Gameplay consists of a basically automated take-off phase, a combat phase, and refueling phase. There are five missions:Mission 1: Red, easy-to-hit, unarmed drones are the only targets.Mission 2: Interceptors are introduced. With no rear gun, they are simple to destroy from behind.Mission 3: Yellow Patrollers follow fixed routes. They are more dangerous than Interceptors. Additionally, Bombers appear, which have rear-fire capability, and absorb a good deal of damage.Mission 4: Stealth fighters are introduced. They are immune to long-range radar, and are heavily armed.Mission 5: Super bombers, with guided missiles are introduced. The player must destroy all five to finish the game.Between stages, the player must refuel to proceed to the following stage. Refueling consists of locating the refueling jet on the long term radar. Next, the afterburner is used to catch up to, and match the speed. Finally, the player must carefully position the aircraft's nose into the refueling hose. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>In Raft Rider you are floating down a river on a raft made out of logs. Your goal is to guide the raft as far down the river as possible while avoiding the many obstacles. You will come across dangerous rocks, trees, beavers (which chop down trees making more obstacles!), and even a moose, all of which can sink your raft. For each segment of river you travel 125 points are earned, and additional bonus points may be earned by collecting gold nuggets which you will encounter in the river from time to time. You begin the game with three rafts (bonus rafts can be earned), and the game ends when all of the rafts have been sunk. Several difficulty levels are available which control the speed of the current, as well as the speed of the beaver and moose.</plot>

				<title_clean>Raiders of the Lost Ark</title_clean>
				<plot>Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Programmer Initials[CR]Note: This Easter egg will only show up if you do the ''secret YAR'' trick beforehand. [CR]Continue the game, making sure you obtain a high score. The initials ''HSW2'' (belonging to programmer Howard Scott Warshaw with the ''2'' indicating that this was his second game) will appear in the inventory at the end of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Programmer Initials[CR]Go to the Flying Saucer Mesa with a parachute and Chai. Walk off the bottom of the mesa; when you start falling, drop the Chai. The YAR will start flying above you at the top of the screen.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]City being destroyed by a monster![CR]Rampage was first released in arcades in 1986 by Bally Midway. Taking inspiration from giant-monster movies like Godzilla and King Kong, Rampage puts players in the role of one of three oversized monsters-- George the ape, Lizzie the lizard, and Ralph the wolf.[CR]The players start wreaking havoc in Peoria, Illinois, then cut a path of destruction through the United States. In the arcade version, the monsters' attacks take place over 128 days. After those days end, the cities start to repeat, and after five cycles you get to day 768 and the days reset to 1. The console iterations had an actual ending added. The goal in each stage is to knock down every building in the city. The monsters can climb up the sides of buildings and punch out sections of their walls, occasionally eating the hapless humans that they find inside. Take out enough pieces of a building and it will come crashing down. Watch out, though--the National Guard is out in force and will harass the monsters with tanks and jets. If enough damage is taken, the monster will revert to its original human form, sans clothes. In a multiplayer situation, any remaining monsters can grab and eat the ex-monster.[CR]Rampage has seen a number of remakes and sequels over the years with varying degrees of success. Follow-ups include Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2: Universal Tour, Rampage Through Time, and Rampage Puzzle Attack, though none of them have garnered the same positive response as the original.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Reactor</title_clean>
				<plot>Reactor is an    arcade video game first released by    Gottlieb in 1982, which was later officially ported to the    Atari 2600 and distributed by    Parker Brothers. Featuring early raster graphics and originally using    trackball controls, the main aim of the game is to prevent a nuclear reactor core from going into critical meltdown by overheating, whilst avoiding alternative waves of magnetism or being hit by enemy radioactive particles. The game was well known in arcades due to its loud, explosive and heart-pounding music and sound effects, meaning that Reactor    arcade cabinets were usually positioned close to the entrance of an arcade as a means of attempting to attract potential players to enter.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The box of the Atari 2600 version of Reactor states that the player represents a small    spaceship which is trapped inside a giant nuclear reactor slowly approaching critical meltdown. The player controls the ship, which can move around within the octagonal nuclear reactor. At the centre is the core itself, which slowly expands to fill more of the reactor as time progresses. Furthermore, the core also exhibits a    gravitational pull against the player&#8217;s ship, which must be countered in order to remain alive. The player must avoid touching either the walls or the reactor core, which will destroy the ship otherwise. Ship movement is achieved via the trackball (or    joystick on the Atari 2600 version), which could be rolled quickly in a certain direction as a means of avoiding the nuclear core&#8217;s gravity. Furthermore, the reactor chamber is filled with a variety of enemy radioactive particles, which float around the core, often rebounding off walls and each other, but normally actively seeking to destroy the player&#8217;s ship by knocking it off-course. Occasionally, a    Boss particle will appear, which can break into smaller particles if and when destroyed.  The object of the game is to avoid the reactor walls, core and enemy particles whilst achieving the highest score possible. The player is able to collide with enemy particles, which can be used to destroy the reactor control rods in order to shrink the size of the core. Playing can take an exceedingly delicate and steady hand. Instead of moving the ship in a horizontal or vertical fashion, as is the case with most video games, the existence of gravity means that the ship will usually spin in a circular fashion around the core, if controlled correctly. At the same time, enemy radioactive particles can become highly charged and aggressive, making it increasingly difficult not to be destroyed against the walls of the reactor. The gravitational effect the core exudes meant that playing a game of Reactor could be extremely tiring, given the energy expelled in rolling the trackball. Thus, it is sometimes considered one of the first arcade video games which can feel rather similar to a sport.  If accelerated at the correct interval, the player&#8217;s ship should orbit the reactor slowly, with enough forward momentum to prevent it from either falling into the core, or from touching the walls. Decoy ships can be placed to lure radioactive particles, or to collide with them in order to rebuff them into the control rods, the core, or one of two bonus chambers, which can contain trapped particles for a period of time. If the primary button was pressed, the player could initiate high power mode. The benefit of this was that it would provide a greater deflection of enemy particles from the ship, with the downside that the ship itself would also suffer greater deflection when hit. In order to provide some assistance to the task of surviving, the player is given a limited supply of decoys to use. The secondary button could place a decoy which would attract particles to it, and thus tempt them inside a bonus chamber for extra points, or push them into destroying a reactor control rod. They could also be deflected directly into the reactor walls and destroyed in that fashion. If a row of reactor rods was successfully destroyed, the player is rewarded with an extra decoy, as well as having the reactor core shrink back to its original starting size.  The time limit on the game is imposed by the growing reactor core, which can severely limit the useable space in which the player can manoeuvre the ship. It is important to note that a game of Reactor can never end with the reactor core actually melting down. Instead, the decreasing space ramps up the    difficulty of the game, until eventually there is no room left in which to move the ship safely. For example, after the first wave of radioactive particles is dealt with, the reactor core can change into a spiral formation, taking up a much greater space and therefore making the game more difficult.  [CR]Development[CR]Reactor was originally developed by    Tim Skelly, who was previously both a designer and programmer for    Cinematronics from 1978 until 1981. Whilst at Cinematronics, Skelly had designed a number of popular vector graphic action games, including        Rip-Off and            Space Hawk. Reactor was the first game he developed while working as an independent software contractor for Gottlieb. Afterward he went on to design two more games, Insector and Screw Loose, but neither was ever released. Reactor is the first game to ever feature a developer&#8217;s name on the title screen, setting the precident for all other games to follow.  [CR]Release History[CR]A version of Reactor was released for the    Atari 2600, also in 1982. Developed and published by    Parker Brothers, this version featured a few minor differences to the arcade version. The largest change was that the ship&#8217;s energy shield was always on, whilst in arcades it had to be activated. Controls could be either a    joystick or a trackball, although the manual included in the game box only specified the use of the joystick. Console    difficulty switches could alter the sensitivity of the ship&#8217;s movement via the joystick, in order to mimic the more delicate arcade controls. The game also lacked any voice over, removed the choice to start with seven lives, and the counter which recorded the bonus score was not displayed. Further, the bonus score could only reach a maximum level, after which any bonus points scored would simply be added to the player&#8217;s main score. The 2600 version also contained a bug which caused collision detection to not function correctly close to the bonus chambers.  A version of Reactor was also licensed and developed for the    Intellivision, but it was never commercially released.  [CR]Cultural Impact[CR]The current World Record score for the original arcade version of Reactor is 448,833 Points, which was achieved by Ed Flores from Santa Maria, California under referee verification on 2nd January, 1983.  The music for Reactor has become something of a cult icon in recent years, since the game's speakers were oringally mounted inside the marquee of the cabinet, providing a loud and reverberating experience for anyone who happened to be standing close by. Furthermore, the Atari 2600 box art has received much praise for its beautifully bright but simple use of colours depicting a large explosion, which are very reminiscient of Pop Art.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra points[CR]Complete a game, then move your ship to the top of the screen and move as far into the corner as possible while the game is in demonstration mode. Your ship will eventually hit an invisible object that will add to your point total. Enough points can be earned in this manner to earn a bonus life and allow the game to be continued at the last point played.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra points[CR]Complete a game, then move your ship to the top of the screen and move as far into the corner as possible while the game is in demonstration mode.

				<plot>This is regulation basketball with some exceptions. There are no three-point shots, no foul-line shots, no time outs, no penalties, no shot clock and neither the player nor the ball can go out of bounds.[CR]You control two players in tandem. You pass balls between each other by pressing the button and pushing the joystick towards the other player. You shoot the same way but by pressing the joystick towards the basket. To steal the ball, just touch the opposing player who has the ball. Simply try to get more baskets than your opponents before the time runs out. Each game is divided into four quarters. After all four quarters are done, the game is over.</plot>

				<plot>It's Friday night at the Garden. You step into the ring. Lefty O'Leary is the heavy favorite, but deep down you know you've got the stuff to put him away. At the sound of the bell Lefty comes out swinging. He jabs, you cover up. You land a hard right to the body. Lefty staggers. He's hurt. You throw a left to his ribs and then a smashing right payoff punch. He's down. The crowd is wild with excitement. The countdown ends and he's still down. You're elated by the triumph, but somehow you know it won't be so easy next time. Because you might be up against Jabbin' Jack, Macho Man, or Iron Fists. And those guys know how to jab, move, and cover up. Next time you just might have to go the full seven rounds.</plot>

				<plot>Volleyball is an action game which can be played by one or two players. The game follows traditional volleyball rules; the first team to score 15 points wins! You control both players on the team, which have the ability to serve, set, spike, and block. There are several game variations included; two game difficulties and two player speeds.  In the easier version of the game, the ball will automatically be sent back over the net when hit. In the advanced version, the game also allows you to set the ball between teammates. In either version of the game with either one or two players, the speed at which the players run can be set to either fast or slow for an extra challenge or to handicap one team.</plot>

				<plot>Terra I supplies Earth with Zenbar crystals, which is used to supply 72% of the power to Earth. Ordinarily, a computer controls the defense systems but it looks to have been sabotaged. Space pirates are in the area and the robot interceptors are working against us. Your orders are to fly your F-117 Starwarrior to Terra I, destroying anything that tries to harm you.[CR]You can move your ship up, down, left or right. You begin with a top-down view if the F-117, facing towards the bottom of the screen. Meteors and later space pirates come from the bottom moving up and you must shoot them. After you get through these, you switch to a side view of the ship and face left or right. Robot interceptors will come from the sides and must be destroyed then fish force fields (yes, fish force fields) will come from the top, moving down and you must shoot the fish-shaped devices to destroy them. They are Terra I's last defensive line so when you get through them, you win.[CR]In the two player games, player one controls the F-117's left and right movement and player two controls the up and down movement therefore players must work together. Firing alternates between both players in two second intervals.</plot>

				<plot>As the Pharoh's Son,  it is up to the player to lift the curse of Anubis, God of the Dead, by reaching the Temple of Ra, and solving the riddle of the Sphinx.[CR]Armed with a sling and a pile of rocks, the Prince must navigate past thieves and scorpions on his journey.  He can trade with wandering nomads, dig for buried treasure, make offerings to the gods, or seek counsel and healing with Isis, the goddess of fertility and motherhood.[CR]Great care must be exercised in his journey, for the Prince can weaken from thirst, which can be be replenished at an oasis or from certain treasures.  He will also sustain wounds from the hostile creatures of the land, including Anubis himself.[CR]Once the Prince visits the various temples of the desert and makes his offerings, he must choose to make the correct offering (or offerings) to the Temple of Ra.  Choose wisely, and the Prince is rewarded.  Choose poorly, and the Prince loses inner strength points, and Egypt remains cursed.</plot>

				<title_clean>River Raid</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Programmed entirely by  Carol Shaw (one of the first female game designers), River Raid puts the player in control of a fighter jet tasked with flying over a river from a  top-down, vertical perspective, shooting enemy vehicles like news helicopters, planes, and civilian cargo ships. Other than dodging enemy vehicles, your primary concern is your jet's fuel level, which slowly depletes over time, and can be replenished by flying over fuel pads found throughout the environment, however shooting a fuel tank will also boost your score by several points, making whether or not to fuel up or go for the points somewhat of a strategic decision. Inexplicably, the plane will also explode if it flies over land. While River Raid features the forced movement common in scrolling shooters, you can affect the speed of the scroll with your jet by pressing either up or down on the control stick.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]River Raid was the first video game in history to be listed by the German Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons, cited for "its intent to compromise the minds of children by forcing a paramilitaristic [sic] education upon them, and the playing of which caused cramps, anger, headaches and aggressiveness". The Department finally admitted that River Raid was harmless in 2002.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Robot Tank</title_clean>
				<plot>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</plot>

				<plot>Our nation's defense system has become computer controlled by robotic regulation. Human intervention and interference have been reduced to a scant minimum. It has proven to be a brilliant concept with a fail-safe design. But, suddenly, something has gone haywire. At one of the Western test sites, a division of armed tanks, the ROBOT TANKS, has stopped obeying commands from Computer Central and is now on the rampage. Thundering over western terrain, blistering everything in sight, they are moving closer to downtown Santa Clara. You must command your own sophisticated Robot Tanks from a remote station and STOP this nonsense. It'll require plenty of stamina, razor-sharp wits and strategic flexibility. Your control panel will monitor the damage to your machines, but you'll have to battle alone. Alone, against the robots.</plot>

				<title_clean>Roc 'n Rope</title_clean>
				<plot>Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides. Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points. [CR]Your player also cannot take a fall, except for extremely small ones unless he is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to "shake" the rope until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope. Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the player.[CR]There are 4 distinct levels; the cliff-side, the windmill, the waterfall and the peak. Completing all of these levels will restart the game with faster enemies and power-ups located in different places.</plot>

				<description>Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle (Prototype 19830420)</description>
				<rom name="MESS_0.151_Software_List_ROMs/a2600.zip/MESS%200.151%20Software%20List%20ROMs%2Fa2600%2Frockybul.zip" size="3447" />
				<title_clean>Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle</title_clean>
				<plot>According to the catalog entry: "Rocky and Bullwinkle must stop the evil Boris and Natasha from robbing a train full of priceless valuables. While Boris uses "Upsidasium" to float the valuables up to Natasha's waiting helicopter, Rocky must fly around and intercept them. When Rocky catches the valuables, he gives them to Bullwinkle for safe keeping."  Now I know the show didn't exactly make sense most of the time, but what heck were the guys over at Mattel smoking when they came up with this plot?[CR]Twisted plot aside, Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle is an interesting action game in which you must fly Rocky around the screen grabbing all the valuables before they float up to Natasha.  R&amp;B sort of plays like Kaboom in reverse, and resembles Dumbo's Flying Circus in some respects.  Treasures can be snagged by flying Rocky over them and pressing the button, but since Rocky has puny little rodent muscles he can only hold two valuables at once.  While you can give any treasure to Bullwinkle for points, there is a special combination that is displayed on the screen, these are the two that actually count.  If you give these two treasures to Bullwinkle the screen will flash a bit and the timer will reset to 75, giving you more time to look for the next combination.  However there's another timer which constantly counts down no matter what you do.  When this timer runs out, the game ends.  This timer can be extended by selecting different game variations. [CR]While you're zipping around the screen Natasha will occasionally drop something out of her plane which looks like a row of brown dots (bullets?) which will cause you to fly out of control for a few seconds if they hit out.  Other than Natasha there's really nothing in this game that can harm you, but since this was a kiddie game it wasn't exactly supposed to be violent.  Bullwinkle will occasionally drop a brown box of some sort which allows Rocky to carry six treasures instead of 2.  The left difficulty switch affects how many treasures you need to give to Bullwinkle (one or two), while the select button changes Rocky's control scheme.  Normally Rocky simply moves left, right, up, and down with the joystick as you would expect, but by pressing the select button you can put him in loop mode (indicated by the arrows at the bottom of the screen).[CR]While Rocky is in loop mode pressing up or right will cause him to do a right loop (the long you hold it down the further he goes into the loop), and pressing left or down will cause Rocky to do a left loop.  While this control scheme may sound difficult, it becomes second nature after a few minutes.[CR]As if the game wasn't strange enough, you can change the shapes into numbers and mathematical symbols by putting the TV Type switch to B&amp;W.  This makes the game a bit more challenging because now the player must add or subtract the numbers they catch to equal the number Bullwinkle is displaying (ack! edutainment!).  In this mode the left difficulty switch controls the difficulty of the numbers (1 or 2 digits).  As with the treasure variation, you can give other numbers to Bullwinkle for points, but they don't count towards the solution.  This variation also lacks the 'storage box' that is present in the treasure variation. [CR]The amazing thing about this prototype isn't the gameplay, it's the graphics.  It's simply amazing how many items are moving on the screen at one time with absolutely no flicker.  The train circles the bottom of the screen puffing smoke, Bullwinkle circles around the sky in his plane, Natasha moves back and forth in the helicopter (shooting at Rocky), and tons of valuables constantly move up the screen.   All of this action actually makes it the screen a bit busy, which has to be a first for any 2600 game.[CR]The 2600 version of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle was actually designed before the Intellivision version, instead of the other way around as was usually the case.  Even though Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle was complete and passed quality assurance, it was canceled for unknown reasons.  The Intellivision version was still on schedule to be released, but Mattel closed their doors before it could be completed.  The rom file for this game exists, but has never been publicly distributed due to copyright reasons. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/rocky/rocky.htm[CR]</plot>

				<rom name="MESS_0.151_Software_List_ROMs/a2600.zip/MESS%200.151%20Software%20List%20ROMs%2Fa2600%2Frubik3d.zip" size="3348" />
				<title_clean>Rubik's Cube 3-D</title_clean>
				<plot>As 2002 was quietly winding down, an announcement was made that took the collecting community off guard.  Long time collector David Winter announced that he had discovered a previously unknown prototype, which appeared to simulate a 3-D Rubik's Cube.  Unfortunately since the prototype had no labels we can't be sure what the actual name is, but all available evidence suggests that it was simply called Rubik's Cube.  So to keep from confusing it with the Rubik's Cube cart Atari did release, we'll call this one 3-D Rubik's Cube. [CR]3-D Rubik's Cube appears to have been in development around the same time as Atari Video Cube as both have a 1982 copyright.  Why Atari would go with the bland "one-side-at-a-time" version when they had this amazing 3-D version is unknown, but there may have been copyright or licensing issues that forced Atari to change the look and feel of the game.  This argument is further supported by the fact that Atari renamed the game "Atari Video Cube" instead of keeping the name Rubik's Cube which is used in this prototype.  However the biggest mystery surrounds the re-release of Atari Video Cube as Rubik's Cube in 1984.  Obviously Atari finally secured the rights to the name, so why not release the 3-D version instead of simply recycling AVC?  Until the programmer for either game can be found, the world may never know.[CR]As you probably already guessed, 3-D Rubik's Cube is a computer simulation of the old Rubik's Cube puzzle that was all the rage back in the mid 80's.  Unlike Atari Video Cube, 3-D Rubik's Cube is displayed in three dimensions so the player can see three of the cube faces at once rather than one.  This makes solving the cube much easier as the player doesn't have to have a super human memory to remember the other five sides.  Since 3-D Rubik's Cube is shown in a proper 3-D perspective, players can manipulate the cube just like they would in the real world.  This is a far cry from Atari Video Cube's gameplay which involved an elf running over squares, picking up and dropping off colors (what the hell were they thinking?). [CR]3-D Rubik's Cube as two different play modes: Normal and Cheat (toggled by the left difficulty switch).  In normal mode the player can rotate the cube in any one of four directions until the desired side appears.  Once a side has been selected, the player can then rotate the individual slices (rows and columns) until they think they have it in the right position.  The player repeats this process until the cube is solved (or they go insane).  In cheat mode, the player can actually set the colors on the cube to what ever they desire.  Players can even create impossible to solve cubes by placing too much of one color or not enough of another.  Due to the strange nature of this "cheat mode", people have begun to speculate it may have been put in for debugging purposes.  It is unknown if it would have been included in the final release. [CR]As if this prototype wasn't amazing enough, 3-D Rubik's Cube even includes a solve mode.  If the player gets too frustrated they can choose to have the computer solve the cube for them (Yes the 2600 IS smarter than you!).  However players cannot activate the solve mode if the colors have been altered in cheat mode, so you'll have to put them back into their original configuration first.  This was done to prevent players from building unsolvable cubes with the cheat mode (there's always one kid who has to ruin it for everybody).  Unfortunately there is no way to automatically restore the colors, so it's up to the player to remember what they changed. The solve mode is actually a step-by-step demonstration (controlled by the fire button), and shows the player each move it is making.  This way players can learn what they did wrong and become better Rubik's Cube solvers (good luck beating those guys who solve them in 10 seconds flat).[CR]The graphics in 3-D Rubik's Cube are simply amazing. While they may have some rough jagged edges, each square on the cube is displayed at the proper angle to give a true 3-D perspective.  It is theorized that the cube is made up of a combination of playfield and character graphics, which allows multiple colored squares to be shown on the same scanline.  The sound effects are pretty standard for a puzzle game, consisting of a beep when rotating the cube, a little victory song upon solving the cube, and a nasty crashing sound when the solve mode fails (due to misuse of the cheat mode).  It's obvious that a lot of hard work went into this game[CR]The only problem with 3-D Rubik's Cube is that the game is just as tedious as the real world puzzle.

				<plot>[CR]Development History[CR]Save The Whales was going to be the first of three games for the  Atari 2600 to be released by 20th Century Fox for environmental causes, with profits from the titles going to organizations to help save the environment. Profits from Save The Whales would have been donated to Green Peace. Save The Whales was finished but was not released by Fox. It was eventually released in 2002 at the Classic Gaming Expo by CGE Services Corporation. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of Save The Whales is to protect a pod of whales from a ship that will fire nets and harpoons down at the whales. Sometimes radioactive waste would float through the level and the player would have to get rid of it by shooting it.  The player must shoot the projectiles and waste without letting them hit their submarine because the player will lose a life.  The game also included difficulty switches which would change the speed of the projectiles and whether the projectiles were larger, slower, easier to shoot nets or smaller, faster harpoons. The game also had a two player mode that would allow another player to control the whaling ship.  [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Sea Battle</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In Sea Battle, two players form fleets of ships, and use strategy and battle tactics to attempt to capture their opponent's harbor. Naval combat is practically a certainty, and players will utilize guns, torpedoes, and mines to engage and sink any opposing ships that block their way to the enemy harbor.[CR]Sea Battle was developed by Ken Smith at APh Technological Consulting, and was released in 1980 for the Intellivision. It was part of the Action Network series of games, and like many APh-developed titles, Sea Battle was also one of the first games released for the Intellivision console. Sears also released Sea Battle under their Tele-Games Super Video Arcade brand. In 2000, an Atari 2600 port was released as a limited edition product for collectors. On March 24th, 2010, Sea Battle was part of the first wave of games to become available in the Xbox 360 Game Room.[CR]It is important to note that Sea Battle has no enemy AI, so without two human players, the game loses a significant amount of its entertainment value.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In every game of Sea Battle, players start with the same assortment of 13 ships, which can be deployed in various manners from their harbor. The ocean map is always the same, as is the harbor positions for both sides. Player one commands the grey navy, whose ships will always face east, and player two commands the tan navy, whose ships always face west.ObjectiveOpposing harbors and fleets[CR]The aim of Sea Battle is to pilot ships into your enemy's harbor, which will capture it and end the battle. Initially, the only two ships that are capable of capturing the harbors are the aircraft carrier and the troop transport. However, if both sides lose these ships, then any ship is eligible for capturing the harbor.[CR]An important key in this objective is that combat, while almost certain, is not a necessity to win the game. Crafty fleet maneuvers and a careless enemy could lead to an easy victory without any ships engaging in combat.Ships[CR]Each player starts with 13 ships in their navy, and can create a maximum of four fleets, consisting of three ships each, at any given time. The various characteristics for each ship are as follows:Number Available: How many of that ship are in your navy. Once the ship sinks, it is gone for the rest of the match.Top Speed: The fastest the ship can move. Fleets move as fast as the slowest ship within them.Acceleration: How long it takes a ship to reach top speed or change direction. This is far more crucial when navigating in combat, since ships out of combat rarely have a reason to move nimbly.Armor: The number of hit points, or HP, of damage a ship can resist before sinking. For example, if a ship has 10 HP of armor, it will sink after taking 11 HP of damage -- 10 for the armor, and another 1 HP to sink it.Weapon Type: There are three kinds of weapons in Sea Battle: Guns, torpedoes, and mines. Guns must be aimed precisely and hit a target at their landing point in the targeting cross-hairs to do damage. Torpedoes do not require this accuracy, and will do damage if they connect with a target anywhere along the path to the targeting cross-hairs. Mines are only used outside of combat, and up to four minefields can be placed invisibly during the strategic phase.Weapon Strength: The amount of damage the weapon deals upon successfully hitting a target.Weapon Range: The distance a ship's targeting cross-hairs can travel to fire weaponry. Short-range weapons will naturally require a ship to get closer to their target before opening fire.Aircraft CarrierAircraft CarrierNumber Available: 1Top Speed: 30 KnotsAcceleration: SlowArmor: 25 HPWeapon Type: GunWeapon Strength: 10 HPWeapon Range: Long[CR]The aircraft carrier is a slow-moving hulk of a ship, with excellent armor and decent weaponry to offset its slow movement. While tempting to take into combat, care should be taken to keep the aircraft carrier floating, as it is one of two ships that can capture the enemy's harbor at any time (the troop transport being the other ship).Troop TransportTroop TransportNumber Available: 1Top Speed: 30 KnotsAcceleration: SluggishArmor: 25 HPWeapon Type: GunWeapon Strength: 7 HPWeapon Range: Very Short[CR]The troop transport can withstand a good amount of damage, much like the aircraft carrier, but its weaponry is well below average for defending itself from enemy ships. While it is fully capable of capturing the enemy's harbor at any time, the troop transport will almost certainly need other ships to defend it from attack.BattleshipBattleshipNumber Available: 2Top Speed: 35 KnotsAcceleration: AverageArmor: 30 HPWeapon Type: GunWeapon Strength: 12 HPWeapon Range: Long[CR]The battleship is the most heavily armored ship in the game, and its speed and weapons are both above average. It may not be the nimblest ship available, but it is a good all-around choice for attacking enemies and protecting high-value ships.SubmarineSubmarineNumber Available: 1Top Speed: 35 KnotsAcceleration: QuickArmor: 15 HPWeapon Type: TorpedoWeapon Strength: 20 HPWeapon Range: Very Long[CR]The submarine is destined for destruction. It's very fast and extremely agile in the water, and its torpedoes are the most powerful weapons available in the combat phase. Its trade-off for incredible attacking power is below-average armor, which means caution must be used in frantic engagements. However, the only weapons that will outright sink a submarine in one hit are mines or another submarine's torpedoes, so it's by no means fragile.DestroyerDestroyerNumber Available: 3Top Speed: 40 KnotsAcceleration: QuickArmor: 15 HPWeapon Type: GunWeapon Strength: 9 HPWeapon Range: Moderate[CR]What the destroyer lacks in armor and weaponry, it makes up for in speed. It's not the ideal choice for most battles, but an expert navigator could overcome its inadequacies. Plus, as the most numerous ship available, it can fill out any fleet formation decently.PT BoatPT BoatNumber Available: 2Top Speed: 40 KnotsAcceleration: Very QuickArmor: 5 HPWeapon Type: TorpedoWeapon Strength: 12 HPWeapon Range: Short[CR]The PT boat's heart and soul lies in running and gunning. It is without doubt the fastest ship available, and its torpedoes make it a very dangerous threat. However, its armor is basically non-existent, so any other ship can sink the PT boat with one direct hit. Its best chance at survival is passing closeby a slow ship, firing torpedoes, and retreating as fast as possible for another run.Mine LayerMine LayerNumber Available: 1Top Speed: 20 KnotsAcceleration: AverageArmor: 15 HPWeapon Type: Gun/MinesWeapon Strength: 6 HP/20 HPWeapon Range: Very Short[CR]The mine layer is a terrible ship in a head-on fight, and doesn't hold much of a chance at surviving against most other ships. The mine layer's true advantage is in its ability to place up to four minefields in the ocean during the strategic phase. These minefields are completely invisible, and the only way the enemy will know the location of one for sure is if they sail a fleet over it, causing 20 HP of damage to the fleet's flagship immediately, and another 20 HP every few seconds if they're careless enough to stay within the minefield. While an extremely dangerous trait, each navy only has one mine layer, and losing the ability to place mines early on in a battle could be a crucial mistake.Mine SweeperMine SweeperNumber Available: 2Top Speed: 30 Knots, 15 Knots in Sweep ModeAcceleration: AverageArmor: 20 HPWeapon Type: GunWeapon Strength: 6 HPWeapon Range: Very Long[CR]The mine sweeper is another ship that should probably avoid direct naval conflict, with incredibly weak weaponry and slightly-above average armor. Its talent is in countering the mine layer, and at any time it can go into Sweep Mode, which will remove any minefields the mine sweeper's fleet runs over. There is no indication as to whether a minefield has been successfully removed, though, and going into Sweep Mode drops the mine sweeper to an extremely slow speed, making it very susceptable to interception from enemy forces.Strategy Phase[CR]Sea Battle opens in the strategy phase with a map of the battlefield, which is an ocean littered with islands. A constant sonar beep will sound off to indicate the passage of time. Each side's ships begin docked at their harbor, and to begin, both sides must begin to form fleets.The ocean map at the beginning of the game[CR]Fleets consist of groups of one to three ships. Each navy can field a maximum of four fleets at any given time, and no fleet can have more than one of the same kind of ship. If the player tries to deploy a duplicate ship into a fleet, or selects a ship that is no longer at the harbor, the game will buzz, and the order will be ignored. The first ship selected for any fleet is considered the flagship, and the second and third ship ship will assume flagship command in that order in the event of sinking. While the fleet size is visible in the strategy phase, the types of ships currently in the fleet are not revealed.[CR]Players move one fleet at a time around the map, positioning them strategically or attempting to push towards the enemy harbor. The active fleet flashes slowly as it is maneuvered around the map. If a mine layer is deployed in a fleet, they can deploy up to four invisible minefields at any point in time.[CR]In the event a fleet needs to be repaired or reorganized, it can be piloted back to its home harbor and ordered to stop. Doing so will remove its ships from the ocean map, and fully repair any damage sustained. The ships can then be redeployed as normal. Regrouping at the home harbor can only be performed a total of three times during the battle.[CR]When two opposing fleets come within combat range of each other, they will begin to flash quickly, and the sonar sound will pause. At this point, either side has roughly five seconds to elect to engage the enemy, sending the battle into the combat phase. In the unlikely event neither side chooses to engage after five seconds, the strategy phase will continue, but if the fleets remain within combat range after a few seconds, they will be offered the opportunity to engage in combat again. When more than one fleet is within combat range, the game will cycle through all possible engagements, giving a player with multiple fleets in range the option of choosing which fleet (if any) they would prefer for combat.Combat Phase[CR]Once one side decides to engage an enemy fleet, the combat phase begins. Here, the screen zooms in on the region surrounding the two fleets, and reveals the exact ships in each fleet. Both players start off in control of their flagship, and can switch between ships as they control one ship at a time against the enemy fleet.Aiming in the combat phase[CR]Ships maneuver about based on their top speed and acceleration, and tend to exhibit inertia similar to heavy watercraft. To fire guns or torpedoes, the aim button must be held (which halts any thrust or steering), and a cross-hair will appear that can be moved about. The limits of the targeting cross-hair are based on a ship's weapon range, but once the cross-hair is brought out through aiming, it will stay consistent in its position relative to the ship if the ship continues to moves.[CR]Once the player fires, a barrage of gunfire or a torpedo, depending on the ship, will shoot out towards the crosshair, and the crosshair will reset (meaning every shot will need to be aimed prior to shooting). If the weapon connects with a ship, there will be an explosion; otherwise, a loud splash will be heard. A hit will deal the weapon's damage against the ship's HP. Hitting land during combat phase will deal 12 HP of damage every few seconds. This can be especially dangerous if a fleet enters combat mode close to land, as their ships may spawn right against land and take damage. When a ship loses its armor and takes any further damage, it sinks.A sinking ship amidst the battle[CR]There are two ways to end the combat phase: completely destroying a fleet, or retreating. To retreat, one player must press the engage button to disengage. An alarm will sound, and fifteen seconds will elapse before the fleet retreats, so care must be taken to avoid any further damage from the enemy. Regardless of end condition, the game will return to the strategic phase afterwards. If the combat phase was ended through retreat, the retreating fleet should move quickly away from the enemy if possible. Otherwise, the opponent will be given the opportunity to re-engage after a few seconds.Basic Strategy[CR]To achieve victory in Sea Battle, it is important to remember the initial condition for victory: sail an aircraft carrier or troop transport into the enemy's harbor. This means a wise player should work to defend both their harbor and their capturing ships above all else. Stationing a fleet as a last line of defense by the harbor is usually a good idea, and protecting routes to the harbor by planting minefields is also helpful, especially since minefields cannot damage the team that planted them.An early victory. Don't leave your harbor undefended![CR]Pairing capturing ships with more offensive ships in a fleet will help ensure their security, should they come under attack. Both capturing ships should not be in the same fleet, as that puts them both at risk in a combat situation. Making a ship other than the aircraft carrier or troop transport the fleet flagships should be considered; that way, if the fleet runs through a minefield, the capturing ships are not severely crippled, since minefields will damage only the flagship first. Battleships, with 30 HP to withstand the 20 HP minefields, are probably a good flagship in these cases. Furthermore, using mine sweepers to escort capturing ships might help stave off an otherwise lethal attack. Losing both the aircraft carrier and troop transport early on means losing the ability to achieve victory until the enemy's capturing ships can be destroyed.[CR]Finally, while remembering one's own fleet configurations is handy in the strategic phase, it is even more useful to try and ascertain what the enemy is using in its fleets. Faster fleets might contain nothing but attack forces, while noticeably slow fleets could be either mine layers looking to lay dangerous minefields or mine sweepers looking to remove an opponent's mines.[CR]Atari 2600 Version[CR]At the July 2000 Classic Gaming Expo, a special version of Sea Battle was released for the Atari 2600 and made available to collectors. This port was likely done by Intellivision Productions, but it was published under the Retrotopia label, a term Intellivision Productions seems to use for its sponsorship of the expo.[CR]This special Atari 2600 version appears to have been a one-time production, and does not appear to be for sale anywhere. For this reason, it is likely quite rare.[CR]Xbox 360 Game Room[CR]The Game Room version of Sea Battle. Note the similar colors of the ships.[CR]Sea Battle was part of the first wave of titles featured in the Xbox 360 Game Room on March 24, 2010.[CR]The game is virtually the same visually, with the exception of Player 2's navy bearing a faint green tone, rather than orange. However, the need to bring up a "virtual numpad" to select fleet and commands not only make the game awkward, but ruins the secrecy of such commands, since players can easily view their opponent's input. This effectively renders the strategy component of Sea Battle completely useless.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You are diving for treasure in perilous waters infested with man-eating fish and vicious sea monsters!  You must be careful to choose just the right moment to dive into the water because you cannot defend yourself while you are diving.[CR]As the game begins, you have four divers but can only control one at a time.  Each diver receives 60 seconds' worth of oxygen for every dive he makes.  Your only defense against the dangerous man-eating fish is a harpoon gunuse it well, for those fish are devious!  You must harpoon all of the fish in the water and enter the sunken Spanish galleon before another fish appears. [CR]Once inside the galleon, you will be confronted by three vicious sea monsters who jealously guard the galleons's three treasure chests.  Your harpoon gun cannot help you now because the sea monsters are invincible.  You must swim quickly to avoid them!  Keep your wits about you as you dodge these clever monsters because they can trick you by passing right through the walls of the ship!  But you can escape them by entering one of the ship's many narrow passageways! [CR]To retrieve the treasure chests filled with gold doubloons and valuable pieces of eight, you must reach the treasure and touch it.  But watch your oxygen level!  When the level is low, youmust return to your boat for more oxygen or drown.  And the way back to your boat is just as dangerous as the journey down because more man-eating fish await you in the waters between your boat and the sunken treasure ship!

				<plot>Your divers are out in the ocean collecting treasure; now that they have found what they're looking for, you need to pilot a submarine and return them safely to the surface! You can carry up to six divers at a time, and when you safely return the six divers to the surface, you move on to the next, faster level. Your sub has a limited supply of oxygen; if your oxygen meter gets too low, you will need to surface to replenish the oxygen supply. If you surface with less than six divers, you lose one of the divers. If you surface with no divers at all, then your sub will explode. To make your task more challenging, numerous giant sharks and enemy submarines travel throughout the waters and can destroy your sub on contact. To help out with these enemies, you have an unlimited supply of torpedoes which can be fired to destroy both the sharks and subs. As the levels progress, the game gets faster and more enemies appear at a time.</plot>

After a time, a tone will sound. This is when the boats on the water below you will stop moving and you need to get above them and 'make the hand off'. Be careful, though, for although the boats stopped moving, the falling items have not. In two-player games, the players alternate.</plot>

				<plot>It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.[CR]You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring.[CR]Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.[CR]Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen.

To do this, a glowing orb called the Sentinel has been sent which can absorb the alien energy. As the Sentinel floats above the various, scrolling landscapes, you need to protect it from attacks by using the light gun to destroy enemies and enemy fire. If you don't destroy an enemy, it will deplete the Sentinels energy supply which will eventually destroy it. There are four levels of increasing difficulty, each with a large boss at the end. To help out on your mission, several bonuses may be encountered from time to time; increased firepower and energy can be acquired when you shoot the bonus capsules that appear. Three levels of difficulty are available.</plot>

				<title_clean>Shootin' Gallery</title_clean>
				<plot>Shootin' Gallery is a target shooting game similar to Sega's Carnival. You control a gun at the bottom of the screen while various types of targets move left and right above. Given a limited amount of ammo, you need to earn as many points as possible by shooting the targets (which include trains, snails, frogs, kangaroos, monkeys, and more). Naturally more points are awarded for targets that are further away or tougher to hit. At the top of the screen is a cuckoo clock which counts down; when time runs out, a cuckoo will eat some of your remaining ammo! To avoid this, the clock can be shot which resets the timer. Every 20,000 points bonus ammo is awarded. When all of your ammo is gone, the game is over and the score calculated.</plot>

				<title_clean>Shuttle Orbiter</title_clean>
				<plot>You must get ten parts from an orbiting factory to an incomplete space station. Unfortunately, a comet passed near Earth and left a space debris field that you will need to avoid.[CR]After the launch, you will see the Earth being circled but four colored dots. At the bottom will be the elapsed time, remaining fuel and four indicator bars. These bars are your orbit altitudes and their colors correspond to the colors of the orbiting dots: white for the shuttle, gold for the station, red for the orbiting factory, and green for the fuel depot.[CR]When you are lower in orbit than an item, you move faster. If you are higher than an item, you move slower. You must match orbit and location with something to dock. Once you are close to something, you switch to the maneuvering display. Now you can interact with an item or avoid it, as in the debris. If you hit something, whether debris or man-made orbiting item, you begin to leak fuel. This means you will use fuel even if you are not firing thrusters. You also have a 25% chance to damage the part in the cargo hold.[CR]Game variations[CR]The difficulty switches and select switch are not used. After you press fire on the joystick, move the stick up or down to select the difficulty level, from 0 to 3. Game 0 has no space debris.[CR]There is no score, just the amount of time it takes you and whether or not you got all ten parts in place without running out of fuel.</plot>

				<title_clean>Sir Lancelot</title_clean>
				<plot>A damsel in distress is being held in a castle by a fire breathing dragon! As Sir Lancelot, you need to ride your winged horse Pegasus to the rescue. Each level in this action game consists of two screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.</plot>

To get back up to speed, either crash into something or ride through grass until you stop then get the skateboard going again.[CR]The scoreboard at the top of the screen is not an obstacle. When you get to it, you just keep going.</plot>

You can ski all day (or night) without getting frostbite, and you never have to wait in a lift line! See if you can get through the slalom gates in record time. Learn to jump the treacherous moguls and dodge the trees hurtling by as you race downhill. Whether you're an experienced snow skier or just someone who's always wanted to try, SKIING by Activision is as close as you can get to the real thing- without leaving the comfort of your home.</plot>

				<title_clean>Sky Diver</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sky Diver for the Atari 2600 is essentially a game of chicken.[CR]Sky divers exit the plane with the fire button, whereby they enter free-fall. In free-fall, they plummet rapidly toward the earth and will squish into the ground if the parachute isn't pulled. When and if, the parachute is pulled, the diver can then control his or her direction of descent, as mitigated by the wind direction and wind speed. When the parachute is pulled, the descent speed is naturally slowed, but this can be at a player's disadvantage when, as in some games, there is but one target to land on for both players.[CR]There are a total of 9 jumps in a game, and each jump can score a maximum of 11 points. Points are earned by landing on the target that is either color-coded or is shared by both players. The later the parachute is pulled, the higher the score is. Wait too long to pull the parachute, though, and the sky diver will squish into the ground with a wet, crunching sound. While missing the target with the parachute pulled is zero points, cratering decreases a player's score by 4. No points are awarded for cratering in the target area.[CR]The ultimate challenge can be found in one of the game options where there is one target shared between the players. The strategy is that if a player holds off pulling his or her chute longer than the other player, then he or she will land on the target first. Only the diver who reaches the target first (and is still alive) gets any points for the jump. If you hold off too long the parachute won't open, and you'll make a permanent impact on the landscape.[CR]There are other options, such as moving targets and an absence of wind, and the difficulty switches alter the size of the targets.While it's hilarious to crater, pulling the chute at the right moment is the key to victory![CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Sky Patrol</title_clean>
				<plot>Also known as Aerial Ace, Sky Patrol was a hot air balloon simulator and was the only Imagic title for the 2600 never to be released. The prototype for this game was shown at the 82 CES show, complete with a mock up of what the production box and label would have looked like.  The picture on the label, displaying World War I vintage biplanes attacking a dirigible,  is interesting as it shows more of what the final game would have looked like if it had been completed[CR]As it stands, the game is playable but very incomplete.  You start the game with a hot air balloon sitting on a launch pad in the middle of a field. You can launch the balloon by filling it with enough hot air, or land it by letting the air out.  The amount of hot air in the balloon is directly controlled by how high the burner flame is, and the burner flame is controlled pushing the joystick up and down.  The height of the burner flame is shown as a red bar at the bottom of the screen.  The green bar displays the amount of fuel for your burner, which is slowly whittled away as you use your burner.  Once the fuel has been completely depleted, your balloon can only hover a few feet off the ground and is completely at the mercy of the wind (so don't let this happen).  If you find yourself having fuel issues, you give yourself unlimited fuel by putting the left difficulty switch in the B position.  The blue bar doesn't appear to be functional, but is probably a distance or damage gauge.  [CR]Pushing right and left will alternate the display between the gauges and your score. [CR]Although you can control the altitude of your balloon by filling or letting the air out of your balloon, you have no direct control over the direction in which you move.  This is where the wind and those little clouds come in.  By moving around to different altitudes you can catch different wind currents and thus somewhat control what direction you're going.  The direction and speed of the wind currents varies depending on the altitude (there are 9 cloud / wind levels in all), but you can tell which way the wind is blowing by watching which way the clouds drift.  Remember that there is a slight delay between when you add or let air out of your balloon and when you change altitude, so plan accordingly.[CR]According to programmer Brad Stewart, the original object of the game was to attempt to get your balloon from Point A to Point B in as fast a time as possible.  However as time went on the design of the game changed into something a bit more action oriented.  According to the new story line the player is now piloting a WWI observation balloon and trying to avoid being shot down by the German army.  This prototype appears to be of the 'action' version of the game, rather than the earlier 'race' version.[CR]As previously mentioned, the goal of the game is stop enemy troops without being shot down.  Although several of the enemy troops are present in the game, they are completely harmless in this early prototype.  As you lazily drift along you will see tanks and anti-aircraft guns that in the final version of the game would have fired on the player, forcing them to ascend upwards to safety.  There are also factories, hangars, and trees to spot, but these objects will not attempt to fire on the player.  There is also what appears to be a man waving his arms next to an odd object at the end of the course.  It is unknown what this is supposed to represent, but it may be a landing zone.  Spotting each object is worth a set amount of points, but if the ground is not visible when you first see an object you will not earn any points until you move off the screen and come back.[CR]The final version of the game would also have introduced enemy planes, dirigibles, rockets, and possibly trains into the enemy mix, making the game far more challenging.  However development of the game was stopped before any of these could be implemented (although parts of the enemy dirigible graphics appear in the game code).  Although Brad's original vision for Sky Patrol would have probably gotten the cold shoulder from the gaming public (hot air balloon racing isn't exactly mainstream), the action oriented observation balloon version might have been quirky enough to be a niche success.

				<plot>You pilot a plane and must rescue animals from cages where they were placed by gorillas. To do this, you fly over a gorilla and drop a bomb, knocking the gorilla off its feet. Once this is done, the animals will be out of their cages and you just touch each one to rescue it. The animal cages will only be open for a limited time, then the gorilla will get back on its feet. You must then knock it down again.[CR]You mustn't take too long rescuing the animals or you will run out of fuel. If you run out of fuel, run into a gorilla or the course walls or, strangely, a cloud, you lose a plane.

				<plot>The goal of this two-players console game is to move your vehicle in a maze so you can shoot missiles at your opponent without getting shot at. [CR]The games features four different mazes to choose from, each faster than the last. Another feature lets you decide to make the missiles faster or slower than the car. The difficulty switch determines whether you can shoot a missile while one of your own is still on the screen. Otherwise, your missile has to hit the enemy or be retrieved by your vehicle before you can launch another one.[CR]You steer your car with a joystick. Each time you hit your enemy with a missile, you get a point. The fist player to get 25 points is the winner.</plot>

Regardless, the player takes control of a Smurf who must rescue Smurfette.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The levels scroll right to left while the player must execute jumps to traverse obstacles. These include fences and stalagmites, while enemies include spiders and bats. The player has an energy bar that depletes over time, while failure to negotiate an obstacle will kill the player. Jumping is the only method in which the player can negotiate obstacles (other than moving the Smurf left and right). The game requires exact jump and timing.Levels include a forest, cavern, and eventually Gargamel's laboratory.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In this children's learning game, you learn music, sorting and color mixing.[CR]With Harmony Smurf, the computer will play four, five or six notes and you must repeat them. After the notes play, they fall to the ground and you must put them in their correct spots. The highest level has invisible notes, you must match by sound only.[CR]There are two modes, changed by the select switch.[CR]In Game Mode, the computer plays and you must duplicate it. In Toy Mode, there are six notes on the ground and you can make any tune you like, the computer doesn't create a tune.[CR]With Handy Smurf, items will move along a conveyor belt and you must sort them into one of three bins. You press the button to close or open gaps to guide the object but don't press too soon or the gap returns to the way it was before after a short time.[CR]In Game Mode, the first five items are sorted by shape, the next five by size and the next five by color then the sequence repeats only faster. In Toy Mode, after each item is sorted, the sorting criteria (shape, size or color) changes randomly.[CR]With Greedy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf has a colored liquid in a glass. Using blue, red, yellow and white spigots, Greedy must put the same color liquid or mix liquids to get the same color in his glass. If he gets it right, he and Clumsy drink up. If he gets it wrong, the glass drains out.[CR]In Game Mode, the colors start easy and get progressively harder. In Toy Mode, the color selection in Clumsy's glass is random.[CR]There is no time limit or penalty if you get something wrong.</plot>

				<title_clean>Sneak 'n Peek</title_clean>
				<plot>Sneak 'n Peek is a computerized version of the game hide and seek. The game is played by two players (or one player against the computer); one player will close his eyes while the other player hides somewhere. After the second player is hidden, the first player needs to locate him in the shortest time possible. After the second player has been located, the roles will then be reversed. The game takes place in an old house with three rooms available as well as the front yard to hide in; each of these four locations contains five different places to hide. The game can be played with fixed or variable hiding locations; in the fixed game, the hiding locations will always be found in the same place, and the variable game will move the hiding places around each time a room is entered. Two difficulty levels are available; in the tougher setting, the entrance to the hiding places is narrower making it tougher to find.</plot>

				<plot>In Solar Fox, your mission is to guide a space ship though a solar cell matrix and collect as many of the solar cells as you can. When all of the cells in a matrix have been collected, you move on to the next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer; if you collect all solar cells before this timer runs out, you will earn bonus points and skip ahead a level. The game ends when you have lost all of your space ships.</plot>

				<plot>Solar Storm is an arcade style action game where you control a spaceship to defend your home planet. Deadly Deltoid ships will be flying in trying to destroy your planet; in addition to this danger, a far off sun has exploded sending debris towards you. Your job is to shoot everything that is heading your way before it reaches your planet (the bottom of the screen). Each time an enemy ship or some debris makes it past you, your planets shield absorbs the energy and heats up; if it overheats, it will be destroyed and the game ends. If your laser ship crashes into any incoming danger, you lose a life (the game also ends if all lives are lost). Every 500 points there is a bonus screen where you have a chance to earn more lives. The longer you last, the faster the game will become.</plot>

				<plot>The Zylons are back, and are attempting another takeover of the galaxy! Your goal is to destroy all of the Zylon fighters you encounter, rescue cadets that are trapped on Zylon planets, and to find the planet Solaris to protect it from the Zylons. Your spaceship is equipped with a galactic map which can be used to warp to different sectors of the galaxy. The map shows the location of Zylon squadrons, Zylon planets, federation starbases, wormholes, clusters of stars, and Solaris when you find it. By warping to the correct sector, you can battle the numerous types of Zylon fighters to keep them from attacking federation bases and planets. Your spaceship has a limited amount of fuel; when you see the fuel gage get too low, you will need to warp to a federation starbase to refuel (make sure you leave enough fuel to warp). When flying over a Zylon controlled planet, you will see your cadets on the surface. If you rescue all of the cadets as you fly past, you will receive bonus points and an extra spaceship. The Zylon's have many different types of fighters which you will encounter, as well as some narrow corridors with blockades which you will need to clear in order to reach new locations in the galaxy.</plot>

				<plot>Sorcerer is an arcade action game which takes place long ago when wizards and sorcerers ruled the earth. The evil wizards have decided to attempt to conquer the earth, and have sent numerous waves of creatures to stop all of the good sorcerers. Your goal is to destroy the various creatures! On the beginning screen of the game, there is a flying platform: you need to jump and catch this platform which will allow you to fly anywhere on the screen. Next you will need to fight screen after screen of dangerous creatures by firing an energy charge at them. After you have successfully destroyed the creatures on the current screen, a treasure will be left behind which can be collected for bonus points and then you can move on to the next screen. From time to time, you may also encounter a cloud with deadly lightning bolts that you must avoid! The longer you survive, the faster the enemies become. Two levels of difficulty as well as a practice mode are available.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The object of the game is to defend the player's hidden mothership from attacking squadrons of alien fighters. The player has three fighter squadrons of their own at their disposal with three ships per squadron. The aliens have six fleets of various sizes; only three of which will appear on the radar screen at any given time. The goal is to destroy the alien fleet and protect the mothership. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game starts in radar mode, where you will see alien fleets moving towards the inner rectangle where the mothership is hidden. The player must select an alien fleet to attack and then dispatch a squadron (blue, white or gold) after the aliens. The player can dispatch all three squadrons at once, however, only one squadron can be dispatched against one alien fleet a time. The player squadrons will only appear in the center of screen after being dispatched.When contact has been established, the game moves on into Battle mode. A dog fight occurs, where the player is represented as a gunsight (resembling &lt; &gt;). The players's attack is fired from the bottom of the screen and converges to where the gunsight was at the time of firing. The alien ships will also be returning fire; any hits to the player's gunsight will lead to one of the player's ships being lost. The player will be returned to the radar screen when either all alien ships or player squadron are destroyed. A warning siren is played as the mothership is under attack. The siren gets faster as more damage is sustained and the game will end if the mothership is destroyed. [CR]Difficulty Modes[CR]LEFT: Controls how well aliens fight in battle. Battle is more fierce in Hard position (A) than in Easy position (B). Aliens ships will be much more maneuverable, fire more frequently and the blasts will fire at a much faster rate as well.RIGHT: Controls the activity on the radar screen while in battle mode. Easy (B) has no activity occurring while in Battle mode, while Hard (A) has all activity continuing while the player is in battle mode at 1/4 of the normal rate. If a dispatched squadron reaches its target fleet, battle will begin with the computer fighting for the player, losing roughly one ship for every four it dispatches. This adds an interesting element of real-time strategy not seen in many games of this time period. [CR]</plot>

There are numerous game variations included which dictate the number of attacking creatures that can appear at a time,  their firing characteristics, and the overall difficulty level.</plot>

				<title_clean>Space Shuttle - A Journey Into Space</title_clean>
				<plot>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</plot>

				<plot>Before you lies a marvelous opportunity to pilot an extremely authentic Space Shuttle mission. Sound and graphics explode off the screen with all the fire and fury of a real Cape Canaveral liftoff. Blast away solid rocket boosters. Open cargo bay doors. Master orbital mechanics, and rendezvous with elusive satellites. Finally, perform a precision deorbit burn. With superheated gasses brilliantly flashing outside your window, surrounded by sonic booms, break through the atmosphere, and land. It is a flight that will call upon all your skills, your inner strength, and your mind.</plot>

				<plot>You are an assault ship that was designed to destroy Hyperion military bases.[CR]You must shoot the bases enough so that the energy meter at the bottom goes from the "+" to the "-". Once the meter gets to "-" the base will explode.[CR]Obviously, the base is not a sitting duck. There is a force field that expands and contracts, base defenders and , in higher rounds, shields. The force field has a gap in it that you can shoot through or you can maneuver inside the field and shoot the base up close. Be careful, though, because you can get caught within the field.[CR]If you touch a shield, the force field, the base or are touched by a defender, you lose a life.[CR]The defenders are fireballs, heat seekers, bouncers, wanderers, and homers.[CR]The scoring is as follows:[CR]Destroy a fireball = 25 Points[CR]Destroy a heat seeker = 100 Points[CR]Destroy a bouncer = 50 Points[CR]Destroy a wanderer = 200 Points[CR]Destroy a homer = 400 Points[CR]You also get 25 points for each hit you get on the base.[CR]When you destroy the first four bases, you get 1,000 points per base; the next four, 2,000 points per base and so on.[CR]You get a bonus ship after every second base you destroy and after every 10,000 points.</plot>

				<plot>Spider Fighter is an arcade style action game somewhat similar to Space Invaders. You control a bug blaster at the bottom of the screen, and need to defend the three pieces of fruit at the top right of the screen. Various types of attacking spiders scurry around rapidly, trying to destroy your blaster and steal the fruit. If all of your fruit is stolen or you lose all of your bug blasters, the game is over. When all the spiders on a round are destroyed, you move on to the next, faster round. If you still have all three pieces of fruit when a round is completed, you receive an extra bug blaster.</plot>

				<plot>The Green Goblin has set a super bomb at the top of a high voltage tower located on the top of a skyscaper! As Spider-Man, you need to scale the building and defuse the bomb. Use your web to climb the building, but be careful of Green Goblin's villians which appear in the windows trying to stop you. If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points. When you reach the top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.</plot>

If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points. When you reach the top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.</plot>

				<plot>It's the future, when droids do battle.  You send your Spiderdroid in to capture a building by covering the structure with its unbreakable Droidweb. Your Spiderdroid lays down a web strand as it crawls along each girder. Once you have strung a web strand completely around an opening, the Spiderdroid flings a web over that opening.  Your objective is to travel all the building's girders so the entire structure is caught in your Droidweb.[CR]But watch out!  The building is swarming with Birddroids out to have your Spiderdroid for lunch.  If you get cornered, use your secret weapon! Press the Joystick's button to cast a magic spell that makes the Birddroids invisible and unable to eat you... but only for a few seconds.  And remember - each of your Spiderdroids can cast only four magic spells. Once you capture the first building, it's time to send your advanced Mummydroid to capture the next one, which is guarded by a horde of Skeledroids!</plot>

				<title_clean>Spike's Peak</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR]Spike's Peak is a Xonox game, sold usually as one side of a "double ender" cartridge, but later on its own. The object of the game is to control Spike, a mountain climber, through multiple stages to reach the to of a mountain.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Meadow Stage[CR]The game screen's top portion consists of the total score, and a body temperature indicator, which shrinks as Spike gets closer to death. If the body temperature gauge runs out before Spike reaches the peak, a life is lost. Spike has three lives.[CR]There are three difficulty levels and five stages of gameplay.Mountain[CR]The first stage is an overview map. Flags indicate the number of lives remaining, and a dot indicates the highest Spike has made it (on previous lives).Meadow[CR]The meadow is a zig-zag route populated by dangerous bears. Spike can take cover in canyons or caves if a bear approaches, and must also take cover if an eagle attack is imminent (an eagle cry alerts the player). Body temperature rapidly decreases while hiding. Additionally, Spike must jump over a stream.Rocky Ledge[CR]Spike must locate and use a piton to climb up a ledge while avoiding boulders, rocks, and a cactus. Additionally, there are gold nuggets to collect for a higher score.Ice Cap[CR]The ice cap is another zig-zag path which the abominable snowman follows. The player is not bound to the path, but must cross it several times. Spike can find an ice axe to plant firmly to avoid falling due to avalanches, and can kill the abominable snowman with it as well.The Peak[CR]Finally, Spike has reached the top of the mountain and can plant a flag for a very large bonus. If any lives are remaining, the player may attempt to climb from the start while adding to the previous score.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Spinning Fireball</title_clean>
				<plot>Talk about a game with convoluted history!  It was once thought that Spinning Fireball (along with Pizza Chef, Immies and Aggies, and A Mysterious Thief), were all unreleased games developed by a company called Zimag which may have also been known as Emag or Vidco.  However after some intense research it was discovered that these games may have been developed in Taiwan and simply patched into NTSC format.  [CR]Spinning Fireball is a half hearted attempt at a 3D target shooting game.  This is probably something that shouldn't have ever been attempted on the 2600, but Vidco decided to try it anyway.  The result is a game that looks decent, but plays horribly.  The goal of the game is to have your wizard create and shoot a fireball at the catapult that movies across the top of the screen.  [CR]The controls for Spinning Fireball are bit difficult to master, which is just as well as you probably won't want to play this game very long.  To create your fireball, simply push and hold the joystick forward.  Once the fireball starts to spin (hence the name Spinning Fireball), press the fire button to shoot it.  The direction the fireball flies is based on the direction it was spinning when the button was pressed (sort of like the hammer throw in Track and Field).  If you are facing right the fireball will rotate clockwise, otherwise if you left the fireball will rotate counterclockwise. If your shot actually manages to hit the catapult (and good luck with that), then you will be taken to the second level.  [CR]While Spinning Fireball may be short on thrills, there are some dangers you will face during your fire slinging exploits.  If your fireball hits the sides of the screen it will bounce back at you.  Likewise if you shoot your fireball straight up, it will come back down (run!).  If you manage to get hit by your wayward fireball, you will lose a life.  Also, the catapult at the top of the screen will occasionally shoot a fireball at you, as you may have guessed, being hit by this fireball will also result in losing a life.  You also have a limited amount of time to finish each level, if the timer hits zero you will (say it with me now) lose a life.  The timer starts a five minutes for the first level, and decreases one minute for each successive level (down to two minutes starting on level four). [CR]While it won't win any awards for good graphics or gameplay, Spinning Fireball is an interesting attempt to breathe some innovation into the tired old shooter formula.  Unfortunately the result was a game that needs more variety and polish before it could be considered fun to play.  The frustrating control scheme makes hitting the catapult more a matter of luck than skill. There's a reason these games never made it to the US.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/firespinner/firespinner.htm[CR]</plot>

Your mission is to shoot down enemy planes, shoot enemy ammo dumps (they look like little black houses) and enemy anti-aircraft guns (they kinda look like sundials). If you fly down too long, you will get a low altitude warning. If you don't correct, you will crash. You can also be shot down by anti-aircraft guns and enemy planes. Push left and right to go those directions but push up to go down and down to go up. Push the fire button to fire machine guns.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spy Hunter is a vehicle-based, vertical scrolling shooter, by legendary game designer George Gomez. The player controls an armored sports car with machine guns, and must destroy enemy cars, helicopters, and boats while protecting civilian vehicles. The track is endless with both street sections, and occasional waterways, where the vehicle switches to an armed boat.The game was well-received and spawned numerous ports, a pinball machine, an unsuccessful arcade sequel (which Gomez took no part in), and reboots.Gameplay[CR]Boat Stage, oil slick is set aflameThe player navigates a series of roads with civilian traffic, enemy cars, and road hazards for the player to either shoot or avoid. Scoring is accomplished by driving on the road (or water as a boat), and destroying enemy vehicles. There is a "High-Low" shifter to drive faster, which increases scoring and danger. Destroying a civilian pauses the score counter. After a short period of time, where a player may die unlimited times, the player has a finite number of lives. Additional lives may be earned though scoring.The vehicle has unlimited ammo for machine gun fire, and may pick up one of three additional weapons during gameplay, by entering the red "Weapons Van". The Weapons Van appears occasionally, and may be called upon in regular intervals. The player must careful line up behind the van, and accelerate into it while driving. Only one special weapon can be held at a time, and each of the three have a limited number of uses. Furthermore, losing a life also causes any special weapons to disappear.Special weapons consist of:Oil Slick - Leaves a slippery trail behind the vehicle, causing enemies to lose traction and crash. Oil slick is set aflame on water sections, and causes enemy boats to burn up.Missiles - Fires a rocket at enemy helicopters. This is the only way to destroy a helicopter.Smoke Screen - Leaves a trail of smoke behind, making it easy to escape from pursuing enemies.Music[CR]The game uses Henri Mancini's Peter Gunn theme as its soundtrack. Originally, it was to be the James Bond theme (which was Gomez' inspiration for the game), but licensing difficulties prevented the use.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In Squeeze Box your goal is to escape from prison! To escape, you will need to blast your way through the wall on either the left or right side of the screen. Once a hole large enough to walk through is formed, you can use it to escape to the next screen. To make the game more difficult, the walls are constantly growing, and if you touch a wall you will lose a life! A second game variation is included where one wall is stationary, and the second wall grows. Your goal is to shoot all of the moving multi-colored wall blocks to turn them white. A row of blocks turns white when they all of have been destroyed; the row will then begin growing again, but you will now longer be able to shoot the blocks! When all of the rows have been changed to white, you will move on to the next level. The third (and final) game variation included is similar to the second one, except that the wall behind you will also move inwards; Your goal is still to shoot your way through the left wall before the right wall catches up to you. Each variation has two difficulty levels, the tougher difficulty has twice as many blocks as the easier.</plot>

				<plot>It's a stampede!! Your job is to round up as many of the calves as you can. The screen scrolls to the right as you chase the calves; if more than three calves get past you, the game is over. The calves all run at different speeds, and when you rope one you earn points based on how fast it was running. As the game progresses, more and more calves will be on the screen at one time, and other obstacles will begin appearing to trip your horse and slow you down.</plot>

				<plot>Ride fast and rope as many stampeding calves as you can. They're all worth points. But keep your eyeballs peeled. You won't always be traveling on 'happy trails.' Since these critters don't all gallop at the same speed, it takes a real cowpuncher to keep 'em herded. And, it takes a lot of fancy ropin' to go with the ridin'. Saddle up - and hang on to your hat! Stampede by Activision is the fastest fun this side of the Pecos.</plot>

				<plot>Star Strike was clearly inspired by the Death Star battle sequence in the movie Star Wars. You fly a space craft into the enemy launch trench. Your mission: to destroy the alien station before Earth passes directly over the launch trench. You must evade the alien ships that are defending the launch trench while being sure to bomb the red "Hot Targets". The very first red target that is missed when the Earth is directly in the middle of the launch trench becomes a missile. The missile is launched and destroys Earth.</plot>

				<title_clean>Star Trek - Strategic Operations Simulator</title_clean>
				<plot>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view</plot>

				<plot>In Jedi Arena, you have to face an opponent in the arena to see who is the true Jedi master. Wandering throughout the arena is a seeker which is capable of firing laser bolts. To be victorious you need to destroy your opponents shield by having the seeker fire laser bolts at it. You are armed only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well as block incoming fire from your opponent. The first player to break through the other players shield wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match! Several game options are included which control the speed of the seeker, or even make the seeker invisible.</plot>

				<title_clean>Star Wars - Return of the Jedi - Death Star Battle</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Star Wars: Return of the Jedi - Death Star Battle released in 1983 by Parker Brothers put you at the helm of the Millennium Falcon on a quest to destroy the Galactic Empires battle station.  The game was based on two different scenarios.  In the first sequence you fought through swarms of Tie-fighters and worked to lower the force field surrounding the Death Star.  As you battled the force field would lower giving you a few moments to scramble through the opening to begin sequence two.  In sequence two, you are faced with more Tie-fighters and the "under construction" Death Star itself.  During the second sequence, the Death Star is constantly having more portions put together to complete its construction and thus making the powerful world destroying super laser operational.  The game charges you with keeping Tie-fighters at bay while successfully chipping away at the outer layers of the Death Star, exposing the laser.  Once you destroy the laser, and Death Star, you complete the level and basically replay the game at higher difficulty.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]   [CR]The Atari 2600 version of the game uses the familiar joystick that controls the Falcon in all directions.  The red button fires lasers from the ship. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Strategic insight from the box[CR]Players take control of a snowspeeder on the planet Hoth, and are pitted against an endless stream of AT-AT walkers marching left to right. If a walker reaches the far right side of the game world, the game ends. The AT-ATs have ports that open periodically; fire a shot into that port, and the walker explodes in one shot. Otherwise, 64 shots are needed to bring one down.[CR]By default, the player has 5 lives and can only take 3 shots before exploding (unless hit by a smart bomb). As the difficulty increases, the AT-ATs become faster, and the game ends when all 5 speeders are destroyed or when they reach Echo Base and destroy it.[CR]Settings can be adjusted to change the movement speed of the walkers, or allow the walkers to fire smart bombs. Another option makes the walkers solid, which causes the ship to crash if it collides with the AT-AT sprite, rather than flying through.[CR]</plot>

The Inviso button makes you invisible to enemies, but also to yourself, so you will have to follow your bullets to work out where on the screen you are.</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Starmaster puts the player in the cockpit of a fighter in deep space. The object of the game is to warp from area to area and destroy enemy ships while avoiding being destroyed. In a stretch for the processing power of the Atari 2600, the game was played in a first-person perspective.  Gameplay  The player warps from sector to sector of space. Each sector contains a friendly starbase, some enemy fighters, both a starbase and fighters, or nothing. The player shoots enemy ships with their lasers and may either dodge enemy fire or absorb the shots with their shields. Shooting lasers or being hit drains the players' energy, as does warping to another sector, as well as simply flying around. If a players energy reaches zero, the player loses 1 life, out of the 4 given at the start of the game. Players can dock with starbases to recharge their energy. Should all the enemy fighters be destroyed or the player loses all 4 lives, the game ends.  Controls  In addition to having a first-person view, the game had some additional innovative features for its time. The game screen would flash a different color if the player destroyed an enemy ship, destroyed enemy fire, or took some hostile fire. On the game's console, flipping the BW/Color switch would flip the display between the map and the actual gameplay screen. Also, it was possible for enemy fire to damage specific systems of the player's ship, such as the lasers, shields, engines, or radars, crippling the player's abilities.  Patches  As a reward for player's efforts, Activision would send a patch to anyone who sent a picture of their screen displaying certain scores.

				<title_clean>Stellar Track</title_clean>
				<plot>This is an Atari 2600 version of a Star Trek game found on many college mainframes.[CR]Like those mainframe programs, it has no graphics, only text. You use the joystick, moving left or right, to select the command you want then press the red button. You then move the joystick left or right to select set the parameters of that command, if there are any. You start by pressing Reset or Select to choose how many enemies you must kill in how many stardates. [CR]The commands and any settings are as follows:[CR]Galaxy Map=a 6x6 grid that starts out empty until you do a long range scan. Afterwards, the quadrants will show a 2 digit number. The left digit is the number of aliens in the area. The right digit will either be a 1 or a zero, depending on whether there is or is not a starbase in that area. Galaxy map costs you no energy or stardates.[CR]LR Scan=Long range scan. This will tell you what is in your quadrant and all the quadrants next to yours. If there are any enemies in your quadrant when you do an LR scan, they will attack you. LR scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.[CR]SR Scan=Short range scan. This shows you the stars, aliens and starbases in your quadrant. You need to do this to destroy aliens and dock with starbases. Like LR Scan, if there are aliens in your quadrant, they will attack after you use SR Scan. Also, like LR Scan, SR Scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.[CR]Warp=Warp is how you move, either from quadrant to quadrant or from sector to sector within a quadrant. You move by setting 2 settings. The first is your direction. You select a direction based on the numbers below:[CR]8  1  2[CR] \ | /[CR]7--*--3[CR] / | \[CR]6  5  4[CR]Next, you select how many quadrants and sectors to move. If you want to move within a quadrant, set the left number to zero so you don't warp out of that quadrant. Warp uses stardates, energy and a turn. If you warp into a quadrant that has only you and stars, the screen will be green. If you warp into a quadrant with aliens or aliens and a starbase, the screen will be red. If you warp into a quadrant with just the starbase, the screen will be gray. You cannot warp through stars. If you try, you lose the stardate and energy but don't go anywhere.[CR]Photon Torpedo=If you hit an enemy with one of these, just one shot kills them. You select the direction with the same numbers as warp. there must be a clear line of sight between you and the enemy; no stars. You carry up to 9 torpedoes and they can be replenished.  Photon torpedoes do not cost energy or time, just a turn.[CR]Phasers=Unlike photon torpedoes, you do not need to be directly in line of the enemy or tell the game where to fire. You just set how strong you want the blast to be, via a three digit number, and the computer fires. The closer you are to the enemy, the harder you hit. Phasers use the amount of energy from you as you fired. You also use a turn.[CR]Status=A status report. This will tell you how many stardates, aliens, energy units and photon torpedoes are left and whether you have taken damage and to what. If you have taken damage, you will see a negative number next to the damaged item. This is how many stardates it will take to repair the item on your own. You cannot leave the quadrant if your engines are damaged. Instead, you must try to warp the number of quadrants that would take that much time. You won't go anywhere but you will repair.[CR]If you dock at a starbase, you are instantly repaired of all damage, refueled and torpedoes are restocked. Starbases are placed randomly in the galaxy and never move or get destroyed. There are always two per galaxy. To dock, warp to the quadrant and sector where the base is, so you over the top of it.[CR]Skill (Difficulty) switches[CR]The right switch controls how easily you take damage. In the Expert (A) position, your chance of taking damage is twice as likely as in the Novice (B) position.[CR]The left switch controls phaser strength. In the Novice (B) position, your phasers are twice as strong as the aliens'. In the Expert (A) position, your phasers are the same strength as the aliens'.</plot>

				<plot>Strawberry Shortcake Musical Match-Ups is a puzzle game where you try to straighten out mixed up Strawberryland characters within a given time limit. When the game begins, a mixed up character will appear on the screen and you need to change the head, body, and legs until they are all from a single character. If a complete character is correctly formed, the character will perform a dance and you will hear their musical theme; if an incomplete character is formed, the musical theme heard will be partially from each of the characters you did create. Several levels of difficulty are included which dictate the time limit and which character needs to be created. In the easier levels, the character you must create will be indicated by text at the bottom of the screen. In the more difficult levels, you must create a character based on the theme song that plays.</plot>

				<plot>Street Racer is an action racing game for one to four players played from an overhead view. The screen is split into two lanes; in one or two player games, each player has a lane. In three and four player games, players must share the lanes. Each game has a two minute and sixteen second time limit, and your goal is to earn as many points as possible by the end of this time. In addition to the basic racing version, several other game variations are included as well. The games available are:[CR]Street Racer: This is the basic race car game. Points are earned by passing other cars.[CR]Slalom: Each player controls a skier and needs to slalom through the course to earn points.[CR]Dodgem: Each player controls a race car and needs to avoid the oncoming obstacles. One point is earned for successfully completing the race course.[CR]Jet Shooter: Each player controls a jet in this game. Points are earned for shooting down the various oncoming planes.[CR]Number Cruncher: Each player controls a motorcycle in this game variation. Various numbers will appear in the race track, and points are earned by running over the numbers.[CR]Scoop Ball: Each player controls a race car with a scoop on the front. The goal is to scoop up the balls that appear in the raceway and then place them in a computer controlled car.</plot>

				<plot>You are sent to check out an abandoned asteroid base called Stronghold. As you approach, drones are launched from the surface. It may be abandoned but apparently the automatic defense system still works.[CR]You must shoot or avoid the drones. If the drones are cloned, and traveling in sets, shooting any drone in the set destroys all the ones in the set, if they are destroyable (see Game variations). You can move in any direction but cannot shoot straight left or right. You can shoot in any other direction, however. After you get past the drones, three shields form near the bottom of the screen. Also, interceptor and patrol ships appear. The interceptors track you and the patrol ships just move back and forth over the shields.[CR]You must shoot through the shields while dodging these ships so you can shoot the command crawler on the asteroid's surface. Be warned, though, that once there is a hole in the shield, the command crawler will shoot through it to destroy you. The crawler tries to stay below you but it is slow. In some game variations, the Mega-Field starts to form at the top of the screen, reducing your maneuvering room(see Game variations).[CR]Difficulty switches[CR]The difficulty switches determine what level you will start on.[CR]Both are set to B=start at level 1[CR]Left is set to A and right is set to B=start at level 9[CR]Left is set to B and right is set to A=start at level 17[CR]Both set to A=start at level 25[CR]Game variations[CR]A=drones cannot be destroyed, only avoided[CR]R=you will keep firing if you hold down the button (Rapid fire)[CR]M=Mega-Field is in the game[CR]C=drones are cloned and travel in sets[CR]Game 1 R; M[CR]Game 2 A; R; M[CR]Game 3 M[CR]Game 4 A; M[CR]Game 5 R[CR]Game 6 A; R[CR]Game 7[CR]Game 8 A[CR]Game 9 R; M; C[CR]Game 10 A; R; M; C[CR]Game 11 M; C[CR]Game 12 A; C[CR]Game 13 R; C[CR]Game 14 A; R; C[CR]Game 15 C[CR]Game 16 A; C</plot>

				<title_clean>Stunt Cycle</title_clean>
				<plot>Stunt Cycle was one of Atari's first "Non-Pong" standalone consoles, and was based off the Atari coin-op of the same name.  The console consisted of a set of handlebar grips, which you could use to make your cycle move faster or slower and a fire button used to make you jump.  The gameplay revolves around making your "Stunt Cycle" jump over cars (ala Evil Knievel) and land safely on the other side without flying off the end of the screen.  Your cycle starts at the top of the screen, where you are given two "rows" of screen space to build up speed before hitting the ramp at the bottom.  The "trick" to the game is to build up enough speed to jump over the cars, but not too much that you go crashing off the edge of the screen.  If you successfully make the jump the row of cars gets wider and you have to go back and jump it again.[CR]Sometime in 1980 Atari decided that Stunt Cycle would make a great 2600 game, so Bob Polaro was tapped to do the conversion.  Using the paddle controllers to simulate the original consoles bike grips, Bob made a perfect port of the standalone console.  One change that was made to the game was the addition of color.  Since the original coin-op and home console were from 1976, the graphics were in Black and White (which was standard at the time).  Since Atari 2600 games had to have the option of color or B&amp;W, some color was added to the game (although not much) to spruce it up.  After a few months of programming, Stunt Cycle was finished and ready to go.[CR]It was around this time that marketing had "brilliant" idea; why not make Stunt Cycle into a Dukes of Hazzard game?  So Bob went back to work retooling the graphics to fit the new Dukes of Hazzard theme.  The cycle was changed into the General Lee, while the row of cars was changed into a lake.  Some Dukes of Hazzard theme music was also added to the game to complete the illusion. [CR]So after a few more months of tinkering, the new Dukes of Hazzard version of Stunt Cycle was good to go, but there was a problem.  Cleaver playtesters soon realized that you could change the speed on the car in mid-air!  This means you could go full blast at the ramp and then slow down suddenly after you've made the jump, but before you've landed.  This basically took the challenge out of the whole game, making it fairly boring.  After Dukes of Hazzard was shelved, programmer Mark Hahn was then tapped to do a totally new Dukes of Hazzard game from scratch (which was never released either). [CR]Did Atari make the right decision in canceling Stunt Cycle?  This is a hard question to answer since it's unknown what Atari's original motives were.  Had Stunt Cycle been released in 1980 as a color port of the coin-op it probably would have been very successful since people who bought it would have known what they were getting, and wouldn't mind the blocky graphics, which were standard for that time.  Had Atari released it as Dukes of Hazzard a year later, people would have probably felt gypped as it wouldn't be long before they realized that the game was nothing more than Stunt Cycle with new graphics.  Atari made the right decision in not releasing the updated Dukes of Hazzard version, but screwed up by not releasing the original Stunt Cycle version.  Chalk this one up to another act of Atari mismanagement.[CR]Strangely Stunt Cycle was never mentioned in any Atari catalogs, and was never assigned a product number.

				<plot>Nighttime in the frigid North Atlantic. Home of the Great White Shark. The Giant Squid. And hundreds of deadly, killer subs. Enemy submarines, that have embarked on a suicide mission that will deal a death blow to our fleet. And only the Captain of one destroyer can stop them now. With an eye on the radar screen and a finger on the trigger, you frantically steam back and forth across the surface, laying down one depth charge pattern after another. The ping of the sonar fills the night. The sound of exploding depth charges fills the ocean, as you pick off one submarine after another, hoping you've picked the perfect moment to sink the glowing nuclear subs.</plot>

				<plot>You're the commander of a submarine in enemy waters.  Use your skills, radar, and luck to take down the enemy ships.  With 8 difficulty settings there is a lot of the game to master as you must start to keep an eye on your fuel, torpedoes, radar, and enemy while avoiding depth charges as the difficulty rises.  You can fire up to two torpedoes at a time. While enemy shows go by your periscope sink as many as you can.  The periscope can turn 360 degrees and look off into the horizon or close to your sub.  Some ships move slower than others, and one of the ships moves so fast that the only way to hit it is by tracking it by radar instead of visually.</plot>

				<plot>Subterranea is a side scrolling shooter. Your goal is to locate treasure crystals within the Hexuplex Caves. Controlling your cave ranger, you need to blast the various types of aerobots which are guarding the cave. When all of the bots on a cave level have been destroyed, a passageway opens allowing you to travel deeper into the caverns. When you reach the last level of the cavern, you can collect the treasure crystal and be transported to the next (more challenging) set of caves and try for another crystal. In addition to the deadly aerobots, be sure not to crash into cave walls; these will drain your energy rapidly, especially if you hit one of the skulls. When all of your reserve cave rangers have crashed, the game is over. As you progress through the caves, they become narrower and the enemies move faster. Standard and advanced skill levels are available.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Cobra</title_clean>
				<plot>Super Cobra is a side scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</plot>

Score touchdowns, extra points, and field goals. Play against the computer or against another player. It's hot, fast, action against the clock. When you're playing against another person, he can pick his own defensive plays. After four downs, he calls the play and you, 'hold that line', or rush the quarterback. With four levels of progressively greater length, selection capability, and difficulty, it's rough and tumble 'Super Football,' at its best!</plot>

				<plot>In Surfer's Paradise, the player's objective is to stay on top of a wave as long as possible. From time to time, a shark will approach the player who can in turn jump to try to avoid the shark. If they fail or if they don't manage to stay on top of the wave, they will drop into the water.[CR]The underwater sequence makes up the second part of the game. Here, the player has to get from the left side of the screen to the right side and back onto their surf board. However, there's a sunken galleon in their way. The player has to navigate a maze of walls in a limited amount of time while also avoiding oncoming jellyfish.[CR]Once the player reaches the top of the board, a new and more difficult round starts. Scoring is achieved by staying on top of the wave as long as possible. Extra lives are awarded for every 1000 points.</plot>

				<title_clean>Surround</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR] Du du du du du du du du     Surround is a two-player game created by  Atari for their Video Computer System, more commonly known as the                 Atari 2600.  Players each control a dot that automatically moves across the screen in a given direction, a direction which can be changed using the joystick. As the player-controlled dots move, they leave a line behind them that cannot be crossed and stays on the field until the round ends. The player must force their opponent to crash into either a line or the stage barriers to score.  Once a player crashes, a point is given to the survivor, the stage resets and the game begins again. The player with the most points wins. Surround, in addition to fellow Atari game Dominos, was the inspiration for the               Light Cycles scene (and subsequent games based on it) from                Disney's cult-classic computer film       Tron, released in 1982. It has also spawned the phone game Snake and the subsequent releases of the same name. [CR]Launch Game[CR]Surround was a North American launch game for the           Atari 2600 on October 1977. The game launched alongside other 2600 launch titles that included: *          Air-Sea Battle*         Basic Math*        Blackjack*       Combat*      Indy 500    *     Star Ship    *    Street Racer*   Video OlympicsNine launch games in total for the Atari 2600 near the end of the disco age.

				<plot>In this game you have entered some underground caverns on another planet. As you try to navigate your way through, you must destroy enemy space ships and force fields. You move the target reticle by moving the joystick and fire weapons by pressing the red button. You can see the ships coming in the distance but if they get too close they will fire on you, causing you to lose energy. If you see a force field, you will see a square to the right. Shoot the square to disable the field. If your ship hits the field, you lose energy. You gain energy when you destroy a ship or disable a force field. Use the map on the top of your screen to determine which path to take, left or right. If you choose the wrong path or run out of energy, the game is over.</plot>

				<plot>[CR]History [CR]This  Atari 2600 game was the first part of an overall series of games and a contest by  Atari at the time of release. Players who were able to solve the game could win real life prizes and a chance to win an overall prize from playing all four games, EarthWorld,  FireWorld,  WaterWorld and  AirWorld. The final game AirWorld was never released, and the final ultimate contest was never completed.   Swordquest: EarthWorld was released in October of 1982. The FireWorld game followed in February 1983, as did the WaterWorld game, but in a limted number of copies.  [CR]The Game[CR]Players of the game had to solve puzzles that involved picking up and dropping  items found in the game in different rooms that would then result in clues. The structure of the game was based upon the classic  Zodiac. The clues could then be looked up in the game's comic book game manual. If all five clues in Swordquest: EarthWorld were found the player could mail their answers into Atari for a chance to play a special version of the game and win a valuable prize.  The prize for the first game, Swordquest: EarthWorld, was a Talisman, The Talisman of Penultimate Truth. It is said that the Talisman was actually made of 18k gold and was encrusted with gems, worth approximately $25,000 at the time of the contest. This first contest had around 5000 entries and only eight of those entries were correct. There was only one final winner of the first contest , Steven Bell of Detroit.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>SwordQuest - WaterWorld</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]SwordQuest: WaterWorld, programmed by  Tod Frye, is the third and final installment of the  SwordQuest series of  Atari 2600 games.  The game is centered around a contest to win the "Crown of Life."  It was bundled with a  comic book, and as the player goes around the game they will find clues that point them to pages and panels in the book.  Words from the comic book eventually spell out a sentence that the player could send in for a chance to compete in the finals and win the gold Crown of Life, encrusted with aquamarines, diamonds, tourmalines, rubies, and sapphies, which was valued at $25,000.WaterWorld is very rare and was originally only available via mail order by the  Atari Fan Club.  It saw a limited retail release afterwards but was never widely distributed and remains highly sought after. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]SwordQuest: WaterWorld is a set of  minigames joined by various rooms.  Various objects were in the seven rooms of the game, which needed to be placed in the correct room to activate a clue.  Unlike the previous SwordQuest games, WaterWorld gave out hints to what object needed to be placed, making the game much less frustrating.  The seven rooms in the game were based on the seven major Chakra, or energy centers in the body.  Like many Atari 2600 games limited by the hardware, the room layout is physically impossible to map and is full of confusing "warps."  Every time the player travels between a room they are forced into one of a variety of minigames.  The minigames are based on getting from one side of the screen to the other and can either have platforms for the player to use or enemies for the player to avoid.  There are only 3 action sequences in WaterWorld: Sea of Sharks, School of Octopi, and Ice Floes.  One where the player must avoid  sharks, one where the player must avoid octopi, and one similar to  Frogger in which the player jumpers across a river on floating ice.  If the player misses a platform or is touched by an enemy they might be transported back to the beginning of the room, but they will never die.  There is no  game over screen in SwordQuest: WaterWorld, as the contest was completely timing based, however if the player fails an action sequence there will be one less item in the room they are about to enter.  This was done to make the game more forgiving than the previous games in which the player would lose the item they were carrying if they failed.The graphics in WaterWorld are generally better than most Atari 2600 games.  There is a short 3D motion effect while leaving a room, and the water is full of colorful blue gradients.  There are more than a dozen detailed objects for the player to pick up in the game, and the hallow, acquatic sound effects are much more pleasant than the jarring beeps of the first two games. Useful Items   Crown - Allows the player to skip all action sequences and travel through rooms freely. Medallion - Allows the player to skip all of the Ice Floe action sequences. Money Purse - Allows the player to skip 1 School of Sharks and 1 Ice Floe action sequence. Royal Seal - Allows the player to skip all of the School of Octopi action sequences. ContestBeing a "contest game" the main purpose of SwordQuest: WaterWorld was as a contest tool.  As an advancement over the previous two games, the game world resets after each clue is found so that the game does not need to be beaten in one sitting.  This feature is often criticized for ruining the game-feeling of WaterWorld and just making it into a competitive contest.  There is no real way to win in WaterWorld other than to discover all of the clues on your own in seperate playthroughs.Despite all of this, the contest of the $25,000 Crown of Life was canceled right before it was scheduled to occur.  The fifteen finalists were given $2,000 each.   Steven Bell and Michael S. Rideout, the winners of the  FireWorld and  EarthWorld contests, recieved $15,000 each.  The Crown of Life is presumed to be owned by  Jack Tramiel and the grand prize, the Sword of Ultimate Sorcery, is known to be in his possession.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Enemy airships are approaching your command base! You need to fly your five plane squadron into battle to defend it. Tac-Scan is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a squadron of five ships at the bottom of the screen, your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the various enemies which will be attacking. If one of the ships in your squadron is hit by enemy fire, it will be destroyed. The game ends when all five ships have been destroyed. As you progress through the game, you will occasionally have the chance to replenish missing ships. Everytime you complete a round by shooting ten enemies, an extra ship will float by on the screen. You can add this ship to your squadron by catching it in an empty space in the formation. Every time you complete four rounds, the game will advance to the next level with increased difficulty!</plot>

				<plot>You are Slinky the tapeworm. You must move about the bean patch, eating beans. Each time you eat a bean, you grow longer and the bean count goes down by one.[CR]Beans appear randomly in the patch and you must eat them before the beetle at the bottom get from left to right to get the count down to zero. If the beetle gets to the right before you get the bean, two more beans will appear in the patch and two more beans are added to the count.[CR]At times, Beeky the bird or Spanky the spider will pass through the bean patch. In later levels, an obstacle will appear in the middle of the patch.[CR]You lose a life if you touch your head (yellow square) to the obstacle or the sides of the patch, touch your head to your body, or Spanky or Beeky touch your head (eat you).[CR]The third patch is night. When you get a bean, you can see the patch for two seconds. If you need more looks, you can press the fire button for another two seconds of light but it costs you a bean.[CR]The levels and their point values are:[CR]Apple (5 points per bean, 50 points for the apple)[CR]Orange (10 points per bean, 100 points for the orange)[CR]Grape (15 points per bean, 150 points for the grapes)[CR]Strawberry (20 points per bean, 200 points for the strawberry)[CR]Banana (25 points per bean, 250 points for the banana)[CR]You get a bonus worm every 1,000 points. You can have up to 4 worms in reserve.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Provide entertainment for your patrons by collecting tips[CR]The gameplay in Tapper is fairly simple: serve beverages to each customer that enters the bar until there are no customers remaining in the bar. For each patron that enters the bar you must fill a glass with a drink from the kegs. When the glass is full you can slide the drink along the aisle towards the advancing customer. Each time you serve customers a drink you will knock the customer away from you. In order to proceed to the next level you have to knock all the customers out of the bar by serving them drinks. In order to knock them out of the bar completely they must be fairly close to the entrance of the bar. If the customer has managed to move up over a third of the aisle then the customer will still get knocked back but hang around to finish their drink. The customer will then proceed to slide the empty mug back at you and continue his advance up the aisle toward you and your kegs.[CR]There are multiple ways to lose a life in Tapper, one of which is breaking mugs. Mugs are broken if there is no one to receive them on either side of the bar. If you are thrown an empty mug and do not catch it before it falls, it will break. This also works the other way as well; if you slide a mug down an aisle that has no customers available to receive the drink it will break. Customers are unavailable to receive your beverages when they are either consuming a previous drink or viewing the entertainment. A life can also be lost if a patron makes their way to your end of the bar where he will then proceed to throw you out of the bar. You are given 2 lives to start off with in the beginning of the game but can pick up additional lives by achieving a certain number of points. When a life is lost you must restart the level with no loss of score.Stages[CR]Tapper features 4 different stages each with their own uniquely themed customers, entertainers and environment. For the first two levels you will be catering to individuals donning cowboy hats in a Saloon. For levels 3-5 you will be bar tending a sporting event where you will serve athletes from various sports. In levels 6-9 you work in a punk bar providing beverages to very odd characters including one that appears to have a safety pin in his head. This stage is where the difficulty curves the largest making it very difficult for most to make it to the next stage. For the last four levels you satisfy aliens at a space station by ridding them of their thirst using your beer/pop.Bonus Round[CR]Bonus Rounds occur after a stage is completed and give you the opportunity to win additional points. Every bonus round consists of a masked man with a villainous smile shaking up cans of beer/pop while your bartenders back is turned. After shaking five of the six cans the masked man then proceed to switch the positions of the cans in an effort to make you forget which one is safe. You, as the bartender have to choose the safe can to open. If you choose the right can a message will display at the bottom of the screen stating "This buds for you" and you will receive a fair amount of points. If you pick one of the cans that was shaken up your bartender will be sprayed with beer/pop and a message saying "Oops" will appear at the bottom of the screen and you will receive no points. Whether you win or lose the bonus round you will still proceed to the next stage.ScoringSaloon patron cleared from bar - 50 pointsSporting Event patron cleared from bar - 75 pointsPunk Bar patron cleared from bar - 100 pointsSpace Station patron cleared from bar - 125 pointsTip collected - 1500 pointsEmpty mug collected - 100 pointsBonus Round won - 3000 points[CR]Root Beer Tapper[CR]Root Beer Tapper was introduced in 1984 because the original version of Tapper (Featuring Budweiser) was thought to have been created to market alcohol to minors. The gameplay is identical to the original, with a few aesthetic changes involving the appearance of the character and the Budweiser logos that were featured in the original.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Targ</title_clean>
				<plot>Port of the of the obscure Exidy coin-op of the same name, Targ is a simple yet strangely addictive action game that never saw a home port.  Originally planned as a CBS release, Targ fairly far along in the development process but shelved due to the crumbling video game market.  Targ was eventually picked up, finished, and released by Telegames as Universal Chaos.  However due to licensing issues, the graphics and name had to be changed.[CR]Targ's gameplay is simple, you must maneuver you ship (the Wummel) through the Crystal City and destroy all the enemy ships before they ram into you.  Sound easy?  Well there's a little catch, the Wummel is constantly moving forward through the maze at breakneck speeds!  It takes several seconds to slow down and turn the Wummel around, making it a risk proposition. This makes a relatively simple game much more challenging (and exciting).  The further you progress into the game, the faster the Wummel and the Ram ships will move.[CR]Due to the limitations of the 2600, the 9x9 maze from the original coin-op has been reduced to 5x9.  This actually makes the game much harder as there is less maze to hide in.  Another change to this version is that the Spector Smuggler is absent.  In the arcade version every now and then one of the squares in the maze will open up and a new ship called the Spector Smuggler will appear.  The Spector acts just like the Ram ships, but shooting it is worth big bonus points which increase with each level.  The Spector is present in the later Telegames version and in Universal Chaos, so one has to wonder if this omission is due to the CBS version being incomplete.[CR]Targ is actually very similar to the Sierra computer game Crossfire, but I guess no one noticed as no copyright suits were ever filed. Targ's sequel, Spectar, was promised for release on the Colecovision, but this version too never saw the light of day.  While it's not exactly a sleeper hit, Targ is still a great game that deserved a better fate.  Just one question; exactly what is a Targ?[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/targ/targ.htm[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Task Force[CR]Terrorists are at it again, and you command anelite anti-terrorist Task Force.  Negotiations have failed, so it's up to you to "take out" the terrorists.  They're holding several highrise buildings, and your Task Force is in position outside.  You have wire-guided missiles to fire any time a terrorist steps into view in a window.  You must fire quickly, because the terrorists never miss you when they have time to get off a shot.  And the terrorist leader on the roof has a neutron bomb that ends it for everybody if he lets it go.  But look before you fire!  The terrorists sometimes push hostages into view...don't shoot if the guy in the window doesn't have a gun. And plan ahead!  You have to wait for new supplies after firing all of your wire-guided missiles. [CR]Take out the 9 terrorists in the first building, then your Task Force heads out to the next hot spot (held by 12 terrorists), and the next (held by 15 terrorists).  Your fourth anti-terrorist operation is a treacherous night raid...and the action only gets hotter after that![CR]~From the Manual[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You are John Q and you want to be rich.[CR]In this game, you start out on the income screen where you try to collect the money (dollar signs) while avoiding the governmental red tape (look like red snakes). You have only one year to get your money and invest it. Each second, a day goes by. My, how time flies.[CR]Once a season, you are sent to the investment/tax shelter screen, where you must collect an icon representing an investment and then grab your portfolio (briefcase). Investments have a 50/50 chance of making or losing money. Also on this screen is a character whose color changes.[CR]What color he is determines who he is:[CR]Black=Eggie, the IRS agent. If he catches you, he will audit you. In these audits, you always lose. You are then taxed at 50% of your income and sent back to the income screen.There are no appeals to tax court.[CR]Pink=Waggie, the CPA. If he catches you (or you go to him), he will charge you $1,000.00 but whatever tax sheltered investment you have, he will put you in a better one.[CR]Green=Toodles, the registered investment adviser. If you two meet, he will put you in the best tax sheltered investment available, thus making you the most profit.[CR]After each season, you are taxed to an amount determined by your tax shelter. The object is to have $1,000,000.00 at the end of the year after taxes.</plot>

				<title_clean>Telepathy</title_clean>
				<plot>Telepathy is one of two known prototype games that were developed for Atari's failed Mindlink controller.  The Mindlink was a headband that player wore on his head and plugged into the joystick port.  The idea was that the Mindlink's sensors would pick up any facial movements or muscle twitches the player would make.  Atari actually said that the Mindlink read the player's thoughts (sure it did...).  The problem was that the Mindlink didn't work very well in initial test runs, and even when it did work players would complain of headaches and dizziness from twitching their face all day.  After disappointing test results, the Mindlink controller was wisely canceled. [CR]Unlike most games of the time, Telepathy has a demo mode which will run through all the screens if the game is left untouched.  Interestingly you can control the player in the demo using the joystick, it's unknown if this was intentional or just a bug.  The game starts off with a really cool sign which descends from the top of the screen telling you which mine your on.  After that you're whisked off to the first screen.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/telepathy/telepathy.htm[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Tempest</title_clean>
				<plot>On the list of games that should never have been tried on the 2600, Tempest has to be near the top.  Why Atari decided they could reproduce a 3D vector game on the 2600 is beyond me, but the results were disastrous.  Thankfully Atari killed off this experiment gone wrong before it could hurt anybody.[CR]I've said it once and I'll say it again; If there's one thing the 2600 doesn't do it's diagonals.  Unfortunately Tempest is chockfull of diagonals as the tubes angle out from the center of the screen to form complex geometric patterns.  This leads us to the next problem, if there's a second thing the 2600 doesn't do it's complex geometric patterns!  The 2600 version gets around this by not having 3D tubes, but rather a flat looking shape with the enemies coming from one side and the player moving on the other.  For some reason the "shape" seems to flux and change a bit as things move around the screen, this is probably the result of a programming glitch.  The "shape" is segmented into what could be called tubes (if you use your imagination), but these "tubes" don't seem to correspond to where the real tubes (which are invisible) are. [CR]This brings us to the next problem, if there's a third thing the 2600 doesn't do it's 3D perspective.  Atari couldn't get around this one; the 3D perspective is what makes Tempest "Tempest".  Atari tried to simulate this by changing the enemy's size to make it look like it was getting closer.  Unfortunately there aren't nearly enough frames of animation to do this, so the enemies sort of jump forward in an awkward fashion.  The enemy graphics are very blocky and becomes even more evident as the size is increased when they approach the outer edge of the tube.  This combined with a very blocky looking "shape" for the board makes for one nasty looking game.[CR]In the programmers defense, they did a wonderful job on Tempest considering they were asked to do the impossible.  Since this version isn't complete, it's really not fair to start judging it yet.  Given some time, I'm sure a much more playable version with improved graphics and smother gameplay could have been put together.  While it probably wouldn't have ever looked like its arcade counterpart, this prototype proves that Tempest could (in a very limited fashion) be done on the 2600.  A later version with some added features like a title screen was reviewed in Ultimate Gamer magazine, but it's unknown what happened to that prototype.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/tempest/tempest.htm[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Challenge a friend or match your reflexes against our very tough computer pro. Here's video tennis that looks, sounds and plays like the real thing. Lay down drop shots, rally from the baseline, or attack your opponent with cross-court volleys. You can even sharply angle your serves to finesse your way to victory. And just like real Tennis, 'Deuce,' 'Ad In' and 'Ad Out' are all part of the game. Practice in slow-motion or go all-out at full speed. Either way, Tennis by Activision is a terrific challenge for tennis buffs and loads of fun for all game fans.</plot>

But be warned, they are guarded by patrolling Core Ranger tanks that if they get you in their line of fire, will destroy you.[CR]There are two types of tanks. The white Sentry tanks only move through existing tunnels and will only fire on you if there is clear space between you and them. The blue Digger tanks will create their own tunnels to pursue you. There is also a Sentry tank at the bottom of the screen that slowly moves towards your reserve tanks. If this tank reaches you reserves before you destroy all six bases, you lose a life. The game is over if you lose all lives.[CR]There are enemy supplies buried in random areas that if you get them will get you bonus points. Later levels have the bases only appear one at a time or have no dirt between you and the enemy tanks, leaving them to pursue you from the start.</plot>

				<title_clean>Thwocker</title_clean>
				<plot>Thwocker was one of the long lost Activision prototypes that finally surfaced in 2001 when it was found a thrift shop along with some other prototypes.  Like most other unreleased Activision games, Thwocker was never mentioned in any catalogs or announced at any gaming expos.  Apparently Activision liked to keep their games secret until they were sure it was going to be released.  Not a bad policy.[CR]Thwocker is a game as strange as its name.  Written by Charlie Heath (of Reactor fame), Thwocker was described as "Joust with musical instruments".  While this isn't a bad description, it really doesn't illustrate all the gameplay elements that make Thwocker such an interesting game.  You control a little conductor (who happens to look like a bowling ball) who must bounce around a maze collecting musical notes for his song.  Along the way you must avoid various musical instruments that are out to get you (can't we all just get along?).  However you can't go grabbing just any musical notes, you must collect them in the proper order.  The current note type needed is shown at the bottom of the screen.  If you touch the wrong type of note you will ricochet off it, send your conductor flying across the screen (usually into a waiting enemy).  After collecting all the notes you must grab the treble clef symbol at the top of the maze to start the song.[CR]Once the song starts to play your character will be able to touch enemies and notes for points (think of it as a power pellet) until the song ends.  After completing the song you can exit the level by touching the exit square.[CR]The controls in Thwocker take a little getting use to, but they're not as tricky as they first seem.  The levels seem to be made out of some kind of springy material, so your character bounces all around the screen.  You can control how high you bounce by pushing up and down.  Pushing down will make the conductor take little bounces, while pressing up (as you touch the ground) will make him bounce really high.  You can stop bouncing all together by pressing the fire button, which will make the conductor sort of "skip" across the level.  You will need to master all these bouncing techniques to successfully complete the level.[CR]Sadly Thwocker is incomplete as there is no way to exit the level.  It was thought that they player simply needed to touch the exit square after completing the song to finish the level, but this does not appear to be the case.  It appears that the code that allows you to destroy the enemy after completing the song also allows you to destroy the exit, so the game appears to be unwinnable.  However after careful examination of the game code, it appears there may be more to Thwocker than meets the eye.  Apparently the player must somehow "combine" the two voices of the song after it starts playing to exit the level.  Unfortunately we haven't figured out how this portion of the game works yet, but it may have something to do with picking up certain objects on the screen.  However just because the code to exit the level exists doesn't mean it's actually possible to do it in the game, so Thwocker may still be unwinnable after all. [CR]Thankfully you can still see the other levels by selecting the higher difficulty levels at the title screen.  Programmer Charlie Heath (who owns the only other known prototype) has said that Thwocker is only around 80% complete when development was cancelled.  One has to wonder what else Charlie had in store for us, as other than the lack of the ability to finish a level Thwocker seems fully playable and complete.  Perhaps there were some minor game or difficulty issues left to work out?  The only glitch I've seen in the game is on the game select screen.  The game number should go from 1 to 10, but there are six games in between 9 and 10.  [CR]Thwocker, along with Kabobber, were victims of the collapsing videogame market in 1984.  It was around this time that Activision decided it was time to get out of the 2600 market and concentrate on the new gaming fad Home Computers.  Activision did release a few new games during the 2600 revival years, but Thwocker was not one of them.  At this point Activision was concentrating on converting arcade games to the 2600 instead of releasing older unpublished games.  What they didn't realize is that the older games they were ignoring were much better than the new games they were putting out (but that's another story).  Thankfully Thwocker finally got its long overdue release, and now we can all enjoy what has to be one of the most unique 2600 games I've ever seen.[CR]These game numbers are represented by a space, another space, a white eigth note, a space, a white quarter note, and a dot.  This is most likely because the game numbers are stored in hex (base 16), so there are 16 games represented.  It is unknown if Charlie actually intended for there to be 16 games or only 10, but since they all seem to be playable one comes to the conclusion that they were indeed planned.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/thwocker/thwocker.htm[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Time Pilot as a 1982 space combat shoot 'em up arcade game from Konami. It was the first game designed by Yoshiki Okamoto. Okamoto was instructed by Konami to design a driving game, where players would try to earn a driver's license while avoiding hazards and other cars. Okamoto, inspired by Namco's Bosconian, ventured to create a space combat game, while also writing code for a driving game to disguise the secret project. Okamoto's superiors were incensed after discovering the truth, but testing revealed that players flocked to Time Pilot. Okamoto would go on to create Gyruss before leaving Konami to join Capcom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of the game is to fly around and shoot ships while trying to avoid crashing into them or getting hit by their bullets, bombs, or homing missiles. Additionally, the player can rescue fellow pilots who are parachuting throughout the level to gain additional points. After the player has shot down 56 normal ships the time period's boss ship will appear. Once the player defeats the boss ship, they move on to the next time period, or if the player completed 2001 they loop back to 1910 and the game starts over again with no ending. The time period enemies and bosses are as follows:Time PeriodEnemy ShipsBoss Ship1910WWI Biplanes Blimp1940WWII MonoplanesB-251970 HelicoptersCH-471982JetsB-522001 UFOs Mothership[CR]Time Pilot on Xbox 360[CR]Time Pilot was released on Xbox Live Arcade on August 30th, 2006 at a cost of 400 Microsoft points.

Using the available moves you need to deplete your opponents energy  and pin him for three counts (though be careful, as some of the more powerful moves also use up a bit of your own energy). If your opponents energy is low enough and you successfully pin him that will count as a fall, and the best out of three falls will win the match!</plot>

				<plot>A downtown skyscraper has caught fire, numerous people are trapped, and you need to come to the rescue! Your goal is to rescue as many survivors as possible from the many floors of the building. On each floor, your fire fighter begins at the bottom of the screen and needs to reach the top where the survivors have taken cover. Blocking your path are numerous (and dangerous) fires. Your fire fighter is equipped with a hose and an unlimited water supply to help you put out the fires. You need to be quick, however, for if you take too long the survivors will die! When you rescue as many survivors as you can and make it back out of the room, the floor is complete and a helicopter will transport you to the next floor. Although it isn't necessary to put out all of the fires on a floor, you will earn bonus points if you do. The higher you get in the building, the tougher the game becomes. Gameplay is for one or two players, and several game variations and difficulty levels are available.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]110m HurdlesTrack &amp; Field is an Olympic themed arcade game developed and published by Konami. It is known as Hyper Olympic in Japan.It has been ported to over nine different platforms including the NES, as well as Xbox Live Arcade, since its original release.Track &amp; Field introduced a button-mashing style of gameplay in which the player must press a button as fast as possible, and their in-game character interacts with the environment accordingly. This style of gameplay is still used today by many popular titles. The arcade release accommodated up to four players at once. The NES version (arguably the most popular) was designed for only two players. Track &amp; Field has received graphical and sound updates, leaderboards, online play, and additional events since its initial release in 1983. The Atari 2600 version included a specialized controller, mimicking the arcade input.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Long JumpIn the arcade version of Track &amp; Field, players had two "run" buttons and one "action" button. The run buttons were used to increase the speed of the character on-screen, while the action button was used to do things like initiate a jump or adjust the angle of a javelin throw. The NES version (possibly due to hardware limitations) had only one run button.100 Meter Dash110 Meter HurdlesHammer ThrowHigh JumpJavelin ThrowLong JumpIn each event, there is a qualifying time or level that the player must achieve to advance to the next event; failing to qualify (in one heat for running events or three tries in the other events) ends the game. Events that were later added to Track &amp; Field after the arcade release include: 100-meter freestyle, skeet shooting, vault, archery, triple jump, weight lifting, and pole vault.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade[CR]A slightly enhanced version of Track &amp; Field was released for XBLA in 2007. It includes full Xbox Live support (ranked and player matches) and in-depth leaderboards.[CR]The Track &amp; Field Legacy[CR]Archery was added after the original arcade release.Over the years, Konami released several games featuring gameplay from the same vein as the original:Konami '88 (1988) (Arcade)Track &amp; Field II (1988) (NES)Track &amp; Field (1992) (Game Boy)International Track &amp; Field (1996) (PS)Hyper Athlete (1996) (Arcade)Nagano Winter Olympics '98 (1998) (N64, PS)International Track &amp; Field 2000 (1999) (N64, PS, GBC)ESPN International Track &amp; Field (2000) (DC, PS2, GBC)Track and Field (2007) (Xbox Live Arcade)New International Track &amp; Field (2008) (NDS)[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The 1984 March of Dimes International Konami/Centuri Track &amp; Field Challenge was the largest video game tournament in history, with over a million contestants, including 800,000 in the US and 200,000 in Japan. The top 3 players from each country formed teams, with the finale taking place in Japan; the US team won the tournament. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR] Trick Shot is the sole billiards game for the Atari 2600. Due to technical limitations, the game can only display three balls (plus the player cue ball) at any given time, so multiple gameplay modes which work around this limitation were implemented. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In each mode, the player controls a cue dot which may be positioned around the cue ball. The fire button controls force; the longer it is held prior to release, the more forceful the shot. English, or spin, is controlled by leaning the joystick prior to releasing the button. There are three distinct gameplay modes.Trickshot[CR]The player must sink each ball in 9 distinct setups. For one or two players. Additionally, practice modes allow the player to work on each setup individually. Two player games may end in a tie.Pool and English Billiards[CR]Each player takes turns using streamlined pocket billiards rules; there is no 8-ball. Various scoring rules differ between Pool and English Billiards, but gameplay is largely the same.[CR] [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Tunnel Runner</title_clean>
				<plot>Tunnel Runner" is an advanced 3D Maze Game, essentially what a 1st person version of Pac-Man game would be like.  Because Tunnel Runner was designed with a built-in expanded memory chip (RAM Plus!), it's 12KB of memory gives it the ability to present the maze in three dimensions.  Therefore, the playfield is a colorful, three-dimensional maze, so you never see yourself... just the walls on either side of you that form the corridors you travel along.  As you move along the passage-ways, additional tunnels appear on either side, which you can turn into by pressing left and right.[CR]Your primary goal is to locate and collect the hidden key, located in a different spot within each maze.  Through the assistance of a MAP, you can maneuver within the maze.  While attempting to locate the key to exit the level, you must also avoid the hungry Zots.  You will discover these enemy creatures throughout the maze.  Successfully recovering the key without being intercepted by the Zot's opens the portal to the next level.  As you pass each level, you will discover that the complexity and difficulty increases, while your MAP gradually reveals less and less information ultimately, your map will be of little use, requiring you to survive solely by instincts and quick thinking![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Instant Transport[CR]If you are in need of a quick escape during a run, hold the button down and rotate the joystick in a circle and you will be transported. This can be used only once per run. The game will get messed up after you complete the 127th level. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of Turmoil is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.[CR]The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds.  The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.[CR]When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens.  There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.</plot>

				<title_clean>Tutankham</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tutankham is an arcade game developed by Konami in 1982; in this game, players control an explorer who is grave robbing Tutankhamun's tomb. Players will search for valuable treasure (a map, an urn, a chest of gold &amp; jewels and most importantly the golden death mask of King Tut) and fight off the various creatures that guard the tomb to ultimately find the way through the catacombs.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players must guide the explorer through a series of progressively more difficult mazes across four different stages. The explorer may move in four directions, but can only fire in two directions, left and right, making the player helpless in vertical shafts. There are also "warp zones" located in random parts of each maze that allow the explorer to be teleported from one area of the maze to another. There are several different creatures that constantly materialize from &#8220;spawning areas&#8221; within the maze and attack including asps, vultures, parrots, bats, dragons and curses. Those creatures can be destroyed to score between 20, and 60 points with either bullets or a "flash bomb&#8221;. The explorer has a single &#8220;flash bomb&#8221; per life and stage that destroys all enemies on the screen.[CR]On each stage, the explorer must pick up keys in order to unlock the door to the room where each of the treasures are kept, allowing progress to the next stage. Along the way the explorer may grab optional treasures (Rings, Crowns, etc.) for bonus points. If the timer reaches zero, the player's ability to fire is removed. Bonus points are awarded based on the amount of extra time left over when a level is completed. After players have recovered all four of King Tut's treasures, the game starts over again with increased difficulty.[CR]Ports[CR]Tutankham was ported to the  Atari 2600,  Atari 8-bit computers,  ColecoVision,  IntelliVision,  Odyssey 2,  Vic-20,  TI-99/4A and most recently the original arcade game is one of the launch games for  Game Room on Xbox Live Arcade.[CR]Additional Information[CR]The game was originally titled Tutankhamen, but the publisher discovered the full name could not fit on the final production arcade cabinet, so the title was shortenedThis game is also known as Horror Maze on  Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits for the  Nintendo DS.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Unknown Universal Game</title_clean>
				<plot>Believe me when I say that this prototype is a complete mystery.  No programmer, no model number, and no company.  We don't even know the name of the game.  The only we have as to the identity of this prototype is the name Universal, which is silk screened onto the EPROM board.  Unfortunately this just raises more questions than it answers.  Universal was an arcade game manufacturer, and licensed all its games to Coleco.  But why would Universal suddenly start programming their own original games for the 2600?[CR]While we may never know the true identity of this game, it's a sure fire bet that it was meant to be a clone of Activision's Dragster (which is really a clone of Atari's Drag Race).  However unlike Dragster or Drag Race which are viewed from the side, this game is viewed from behind.  The perspective is similar to that of Activision's Enduro, right down to the vanishing point on the horizon.   It's immediately obvious from the graphics that alot of work was being put into this game.[CR]As previously mentioned, this game is really just a clone of Dragster.  The player must rev his engine and change gears as fast as possible without blowing the engine.  However unlike Dragster the player actually has control over his car and can steer it around the lane.  The faster the player goes, the further the car will move into the horizon and the harder it is to keep from crashing into the sides of the lane.  Careful steering is a must if you're going to win a race in this game.[CR]The controls in this prototype are a bit screwy, and can easily frustrate someone who isn't familiar with them.  Starting the race is particularly annoying, as the player must press left, up, and right until the little man drops the white flag (or the light turns green).  Once the race has started, pressing up will cause the car to accelerate, while pressing down will change gears.  When pressing down the gear indicator will briefly change from N (Neutral) to C indicating that you are changing gears, continuing to press down will cause the car to shift into gears 1 through 4.  [CR]As you increase your speed the meter at the bottom of the screen will show your current engine temperature.  If you go too fast in a low gear, your engine will blow.  By shifting gears at the proper time you will enable your car to move faster without blowing the engine.  Once you've reached the finish line, you must press the fire button to launch your parachute and slow your car down.  If you do not launch your parachute in time your car will crash.  Pressing the select button will enable the computer driver which takes over the first players spot (the car will turn yellow).  To race against the computer you will have to use the second players joystick.  There are three different computer components to race against, a yellow car, blue car, and finally a red car.  You will have to race the blue and yellow cars a few times in order to see the red car. [CR]There are two different racing variations available in this prototype, which can be selected by toggling the left difficulty switch. When the switch is in the A position the race takes place on a city street (which looks suspiciously like Sega's Turbo) with stock cars and a man with a white flag that starts the race.  When the switch is in the B position the race takes place out in the desert with dragsters and the race is started by an automatic light.  This is little difference between the two except the dragster variation moves faster than the stock car variation (the player must switch gears faster).  While it may appear that there is no one player option for the dragster variation, there actually is but you really have to work to get to it.  In order to get to the one player dragster race you must first beat all three opponents (yellow, blue, and red), and then you will start the next race in the desert. [CR]While it isn't the best game out there, this racing game show promise and it's mysterious nature simply adds to allure.  This prototype was auctioned off by Best Electronics in 2004, and released by Curt Vendel of the Atari History Museum on Atari Age for the classic gaming community to enjoy.  Expect more information on this prototype soon.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/unknown3/unknown3.htm[CR]</plot>

				<plot>This is a home port of a 1983 Sega arcade game that was distributed by Bally Midway.[CR]The object is to drive around a twisty course and collect all the colored flags. You can jump over gaps and over or onto other cars. If you land on another car, you kill them and collect points. You can also collect things like balloons and ice cream cones for bonus points. The faster you collect all the flags, the bigger a time bonus you get.[CR]In later levels, there are dead-ends or gaps and a vehicle that is carrying a flag you need, so you will need to jump on him. If you are hit by another vehicle or go off the course, you lose a life. In two player games, play alternates.</plot>

				<plot>This rare game was only available to owners of Magicard, making it perhaps the rarest of all 2600 games. It was only available directly from CommaVid, who sent a letter to owners of Magicard with an offer to purchase Video Life. We believe fewer than 500 copies of Video Life were produced and there are probably many fewer still floating about today. Video Life is a version of the classic computer-based life simulator in which you create an organism and watch it grow.[CR]http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=584[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In Wabbit you control farmer Billie Sue who needs to protect her carrot crops! The field is being overrun by rabbits, and you need to chase them away. On each side of the screen are five rabbit holes; the rabbits will come running out of the holes and try to steal the carrots. You need to throw rotten eggs at the rabbits to scare them away. Every time the rabbits get away with a carrot, a point is added to their score. Every time you hit a rabbit with an egg, you will receive points.  For every 100 points you earn, the rabbits will lose 25 points. The game ends when the rabbits have reached 100 points. Several game variations are included which allow one, two, or three rabbits to appear at a time.</plot>

				<title_clean>Warlords</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR]Warlords was originally produced for the       Atari 2600, a paddle game which pitted 4 players, computer or live, against each other. Each player has a wall surrounding a "king", and if his or her king is eliminated that player is out of the game. Players control a paddle which deflects or catches a "fireball" which bounces about the screen. Each time the fireball hits a brick in the wall of one of the players, the brick is destroyed, similar to         Breakout or        Arkanoid. The fireball then bounces away at a direct angle of deflection. This may mean it will hit the defending paddle, bouncing back into the wall again.  When the king is struck by the fireball, he is killed and the paddle defending the king is taken out of the game.  You can still see the paddle, though, during the flashes that occur when a fireball strikes a wall segment.The fun of this game has managed to transcend its seemingly primitive beginnings, and many versions have since cropped up, including an    unlockable game hidden in     Lunar the Silver Star. Unfortunately, the lack of paddle control diminishes the precise handling that made the original game so much fun to play.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You're warping along fine when suddenly you are caught and unable to maneuver. Suddenly, space pirates approach attempting to disable you so they can board. The only thing you have left is your tachyon launcher that moves back and forth and fires a tachyon beam. Hold off the space pirates for as long as you can.[CR]Using your paddle controllers, move the tachyon launcher left or right and press the button to fire a tachyon beam. The beam only travels up. Destroy the pirates and avoid them colliding with you. Sometimes the pirates travel on groups. Destroy any pirate in a group to kill the whole group.  You only have one life. Once you die, player two can begin by pressing the button on their paddles or you can press the Reset switch to start a new game.[CR]Game variations[CR]The only variation is one or two player. The difficulty switches are not used.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]You score one point for each enemy killed.

				<plot>The lost Imagic gameOne of the victims of the 1984 computer game industry crash, Wing War for the Atari 2600 was only released in Europe for PAL-compatible systems.  It was the only Imagic game that was not released in North America.In it, the player takes the role of a dragon.  This dragon collects eggs and elemental crystals, which it returns to its lair.  The eggs will hatch into more dragons, while the crystals give the dragon increased power if combined properly, though they can't be placed together if in opposition at the lair, lest they annihilate each other.Standing between the dragon and collecting these objects are various creatures which take a number of hits to kill (many drop the crystals you need when defeated).  Your dragon destroys these enemies with fireballs, but these are limited and so must be used prudently as they do not replenish.When the player dies, any eggs the player has collected can hatch into a new dragon with a ten fireball supply, so eggs are extra lives, in a sense.  Maneuvering resembles Joust in that the fire button flaps the dragon's wings, while fireballs are released through the unorthodox use of the upper-right diagonal on the joystick.Each dragon can take 10 hits before it becomes vulnerable, dying with the next hit.  There are multiple, varied dungeon areas to explore, and the stronger enemies increase in damage capacity as the game progresses (see the 2 , below).  Crystal collection and combination, retrieving the diamond, and killing enemies each scores points.The types of creatures (or obstacles), their crystal rewards if any, and their hit capacity is as follows (organized alphabetically):Bat - 1 hit - air crystal Beehive - 2 hits - fire    Bee Swarm - 1 hit - air  Bird - 1 hit - air   Dragonfly - 2 hits - water  Fire Demon - 2 hits - fire Griffin - 1 hit - water Hydra - 2 hits - water Rock Demon - 6 hits - no drop Roper - 2 hits - fire Spider - 1 hit - no drop Stalactite - can't damage   See Atari Age for more information.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Wizard of Wor</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of a never-ending series of maze-like dungeons, randomly drawn from a large pool of pre-set designs. Each dungeon has doors on either side that warp around to the other side (similar to Pac-Man) Players control "Worriors", and must clear each dungeon of monsters.This game has single-player or simultaneous two-player co-op gameplay. Player One takes the yellow Worrior (right-hand side), and Player Two takes the blue Worrior (left-hand side). In the arcade version's single-player mode, the blue Worrior is controlled by the CPU. Wizard of Wor ScreenThe enemies consist of:Burwor (Blue)Garwor (Yellow)Thorwor (Red)WorlukWizard of WorIf a player or monster uses one of the doors, it closes, temporarily sealing the tunnel. On the Atari 2600 version, the tunnel simply opens and closes periodically.Like Asteroids, the game's enemies move to an audible tempo that increases over time; the longer players take to clear a dungeon, the faster the enemies will move.There are 3 types of Worling - Burwor, Garwor, and Thorwor - in ascending order of speed and viciousness. All Worlings can shoot at the players. Garwor and Thorwor can turn invisible, only becoming visible again when they enter the same corridor as a player. All monsters, including invisible ones, are displayed as blips on the radar display at the bottom of the screen. Players must use this radar to keep track of invisible Worlings.Once a dungeon is cleared of all monsters, from the second dungeon on, there is a random chance that the winged Worluk - the Wizard's familiar - may appear. Worluk appears at a random position in the maze, and makes for an exit tunnel. If the players manage to bullseye Worluk before it escapes, the next level is a "Double Score Dungeon" granting a 2x score-multiplier for that level.If the players manage to kill Worluk, there is a random chance that the angry Wizard of Wor will then appear. The Wizard teleports around the maze randomly, casting deadly lighting bolts, until either the Wizard or a player is killed.On the Bally Astrocade, this game was released as "The Incredible Wizard." The port there makes some graphical cuts and eliminates the CPU-controlled player, but the sound is astoundingly similar to the arcade release.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>X-Man</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]X-Man was the brainchild of Alan Roberts (not to be confused with Codemasters' Alan Roberts), a once- and future- director of soft-core pornography. The only other name listed as being responsible for the game is "H. K. Poon," who appears to have had no previous or subsequent video game credits.[CR]In the wake of Atari's unsuccessful legal challenge against Activision, many small publishers and individuals realized that a market for third-party Atari games was now open, and they rushed to fill that market with products that Atari could not or would not provide. X-Man's raison d'etre was not an advance in gameplay or technology, but rather pure sexual titillation pandering to adult owners of the supposedly family-friendly console.[CR]The gameplay itself resembles a simpler version of Maze Craze, the goal being to direct the titular X-Man to the center of the screen where an anonymous (but titular) woman awaits him. At that point, congress begins, represented by the sort of rhythm minigame that would later be featured in such AAA titles as God of War and RapeLay. Once the player is finished earning bonus points during this phase (30 seconds), the next maze is initiated.[CR]The game sold incredibly poorly--a fact which Roberts blamed on the controversy surrounding the recently-released Custer's Revenge--and Universal Gamex closed its doors soon after. Roberts returned to the cinema, to direct the cinematic classic The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood.[CR]The fate of H. K. Poon is currently unknown.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Xenophobe</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Arcade version with the middle player station activated.[CR]Xenophobe in the arcades had a very unique look. There were 3 flight joystick type controls, which is a very odd choice for a side scrolling action game with humanoid characters. The game allowed for 3 player coop, and the screen would be split 3 times, which worked well for the corridor nature of the gameplay. Many of the alien designs were modeled heavily off of Aliens / H.R. Giger's artwork, although with a cartoony bent to things, with very expressive faces on the larger versions of the aliens. There was a loving, satirical bent to a lot of the background choices and features, including having a Star-Trek style beaming down sequence, as well as some of the player characters resembling figures from popular culture.[CR]Some of the home versions of the game, such as the Lynx version, allowed for extra gameplay features and items. Unfortunately, most of the special items were originally supposed to be included with all versions, but these were scaled back before the arcade version was released.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Character selection varied depending upon which version you were playing, although you often got to select from different crew-members. They only varied in looks, but each had a different, expressive head and corresponding animations, and in the arcade version they were in teams of three with differently colored uniforms.[CR]Once each player selected their character, you approach the first base and beam down. Your character begins with a weapon resembling a phaser, which fires small, short-range energy pulses. Should you get knocked down, you will lose grip on your weapon and it will be sent flying. If this happens too often, the weapon will explode, leaving you with only your fists to defend yourself. There is, however, a little droid that will roam around and dispense phasers, usually if a player is unarmed for a considerable length of time.[CR]Players navigate the base by moving right or left, and they may jump or crouch. Ducking decreases speed but also decreases your profile, so it's often recommended unless you're in a hurry. There are also items on the ground, some of which are picked up by pressing a button. These may restore your health, solve a puzzle, or will just give you points (although originally all items were planned with one use in mind). You may also interact with glowing buttons in the background, which can halt a base's self destruct sequence (or start it), change displays, activate elevators, or other actions.All three players are active. Mr. Eeez is on the ground, looking sheepish.[CR]Should a player be knocked down, they can still shoot in one direction until they pick themselves up off the ground. In a desperate situation it's safer to keep firing rather than right yourself, because when lying down you're already as low as you can go. Getting up again may mean you get knocked down, increasing the chance your weapon will be destroyed and preventing you from doing as much damage as you could in the same length of time.[CR]In multiplayer games you work cooperatively, although you can still be a bastard and take all the items. There are also grenades which can do a significant amount of damage to enemies, or to friends. Fists, too, damage fellow player characters. Players can stay in the same room and help each other fend of aliens, or they can split up (always a good idea, huh?).[CR]Play continues until all aliens are eliminated from the base or ship, the base self destructs, players activate the evacuation sequence, or all player characters are killed. Should everyone survive, bonuses are totaled up and the intrepid crew heads to the next infestation site to beam down again. It's worth noting that the thing characters beam down from is a disc that the player ship sends to each of the bases. You're seen beaming down from that disc, rather than the ship itself, which is slightly more plausible than the Star Trek version of beaming![CR]Enemies and Obstacles[CR]Mr. M. Brace taking a stroll on the surface of an infested planet.[CR]The enemies in the game are aliens reminiscent of Giger's Alien, but only somewhat. It grows rapidly in stages, eventually reaching a point where they're a serious threat to your health. Aliens also have tentacle arms which reach through the floor and ceiling; if they grab you they slowly damage you, though they can be blasted away with a few hits. There are also several obstacles in the game, including a malfunctioning grenade dispenser that fires off grenades at random, an electrified field, and acidic slime dripping from the ceiling. There are also amoebae and out-of-control defense drones that don't know friend from foe.[CR]The aliens in the game contribute to a percentage of infestation. If this percentage is reduced to zero, you clear the stage immediately and are extracted from the base. This gives you a significant bonus of points, much more than if the self-destruct timer destroys the base.[CR]Alien stages are as follows:Pod (early stage): The first two stages are when the creatures are at their weakest. A few hits should kill them.Pod (late stage): Little difference between the two beginning egg stages and this, except if it changes again you will be facing a creature that can actually do damageCritter: Resembling a cornucopia with legs sticking out, this little bugger crawls along the ground and attaches to an explorer if it gets close enough. You must throw it off as soon as possible, because it nibbles on you until it's thrown loose, causing damage over time.Rollerbaby: The next stage is one of the most troublesome. In its open form it merely crawls along the ground and does damage to the player character, but if it rolls up into a ball it is all but indestructible, going so far as to deflect weapons fire. Blasting it will also make it bounce around the room, causing characters damage if it makes contact with them.Snotterpillar (full-grown): This the deadliest of the normal aliens. It has a lot of hit points, and takes quick leaps in the rooms, bowling characters over and causing significant damage. It also flings acidic spit at you from a distance. These guys can be blasted apart in mid air as they're about to hit you, which is super awesome.[CR]In addition to the main aliens, there are especially deadly aliens with psychic powers (called Festor) that appear by peeking around doorways and from behind scenery in the darker sections. If your character is standing and facing them too closely, they will be caught in an electric brain beam, causing a lot of damage and throwing them far once they're released. This creature also throws pre-pod eggs that cause damage as well, and in some versions these can become new pods.[CR]It's worth noting that the aliens themselves are generated randomly throughout the level. Killing end-stage aliens does not mean you're less likely to see more end-stagers later, and killing eggs doesn't decrease the overall alien count. So you can shift from room to room to try to get a more favorable situation, but it's often risky to do so.[CR]Weaponry[CR]In addition to your normal blaster, you can find grenades that are thrown in a short arc and do a lot of damage to enemies and allies nearby. These are very dangerous and take some getting used to.[CR]In addition there are several firearms which have strengths and weaknesses:A laser-like beam weapon that shoots at extreme distance rapidly, but doesn't do much more damage than the basic weapon.A lightning gun that fires at a moderate distance but does a lot of damageAn extermination gas gun that shoots a very short distance but does extreme damage[CR]Resolution[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] continues until all players are eliminated, assuming continues are not an option. In the Lynx version you were allowed to go through the roster of main characters before the game was over.[CR]Player with the highest score has bragging rights![CR]Lynx Version[CR]The Atari Lynx allowed for multiple players by linking several systems together. In addition, one player could actually play one of the aliens and grief the other players by jumping at them, spitting at them (meaning in the game), and stealing items off the ground.[CR]Items were more functional than in other versions, and one item worth noting was the jet pack (which could be just as harmful as helpful to the user!). It also has an end boss (!) called the Mother Festor.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.[CR]Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time.

				<plot>You are Rockford, and you have to dig through monster infested caves in search of diamonds. In each level you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.</plot>
