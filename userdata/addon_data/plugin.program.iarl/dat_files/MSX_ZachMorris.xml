					<plot>The main idea of this game is that players take control of a football team and have the task of trying to score a touchdown before the clock runs out.Players start out as a high school team. Games consists of two halves. One touchdown must be scored before time runs out in each half or the game is lost. After a touchdown is scored, the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves, they win the game, and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown.Since the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the players score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point. Other rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or go four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards.In a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense.</plot>

					<plot>F-1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1 is a top down Formula One Racing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released for the MSX in Japan and Europe in 1987. The game engine is very similar to Konami's Road Fighter. It also features Konami's custom sound chip called Konami SCC (a five-channel chip that compliments the three-channel PSG chip of the MSX computer system, or in other words, a sound custom chip that brings five voices more to the three voices of the PSG sound chip on the system), and great MSX1 graphics to go with it. It was one of the first ROM on MSX with this sound feature. Together with its &quot;3D&quot; spinoff (F-1 Spirit: 3D Special), F-1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1 was the most extended racing game Konami released for the MSX.</plot>

					<plot>Robin was repairing the Batmobile when he was kidnapped. Before Batman can contemplate rescuing him, he must reassemble the car from its seven parts. There are all over the Batcave, in this isometric arcade adventure taking in over 150 screens. Initially Batman lacks his super powers, which must be collected. The Batbag allows you to pick up and drop objects, Jet Batboots allow you to jump, the Thruster allows Road-Runnering (movement while you fall), and the Low Gravity Batbelt keeps you in the air for longer.Short-term bonuses of invincibility, extra energy, and extra life and an enhanced jump can be collected, but there is also one which neutralises all power-ups. You have eight lives, but each cluster of Batstones acts as a restart point - when it is game over you can return to that spot, with lives and equipment as they were.</plot>

					<plot>Electric Dreams' game based on the 1986 film Aliens is a first-person strategy game somewhat similar to Space Hulk. The player controls six characters from a remote terminal, guiding them through a 255-room complex in search of the Alien Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander.The player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!).Aliens prowl the complex and are attracted to gunfire. They will home in on nearby characters and attack, requiring the player to aim that character's gun to defend against the rushing Alien (a headshot kills instantly, while three to the body do the same).  If an Alien attacks a character the player is not controlling, they will &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; that character (indicated by a yellow status light). The player must guide another character to the position of the hostage and kill the guarding Alien to rescue them. If not, the captured character will be lost.Ammunition for all characters is limited, and refilled only by making a trip to the complex's armory. Similarly, a medical bay can replenish any damage. Characters also have limited stamina, used up with every move made. When stamina is low, the player must find a safe spot for that character to rest up. The complex also houses a generator controlling the lights, which the Aliens can destroy, or the Marines can then repair.</plot>

If not, the captured character will be lost.Ammunition for all characters is limited, and refilled only by making a trip to the complex's armory. Similarly, a medical bay can replenish any damage. Characters also have limited stamina, used up with every move made. When stamina is low, the player must find a safe spot for that character to rest up. The complex also houses a generator controlling the lights, which the Aliens can destroy, or the Marines can then repair.</plot>

A rain of well placed blows can produce a quick knockout, but normally you must hit your opponent many times before he goes down.The game has three play modes. There is training mode to train your player before you enter a tournament. A ranking mode where you can select one of the three championships, Rookie, Japan and World. Each championship can be played at five difficulty levels.The third mode is the tournament mode.To reach the number one spot in the ranking or tournament mode you must train your boxer well.Before you start you must create your character and set his initial abilities, strength, speed and stamina.Each won bout increases these abilities slightly.The abilities of your opponent and you are visible in the status bar at the top of the screen during the game. Strength is represented with a boxing glove, speed with a shoe and stamina with a dumb bell.This game can be played by one player against the computer or by two players against each other.A password is given after each won bout and it enables you to continue with the next match in a tournament at a later time.</plot>

					<plot>Cobra Command is an arcade conversion of a helicopter shooting game from Data East.  It is an &amp;quot;on rails&amp;quot; style shooter with the player controlling only the aiming of the shooting but not the direction of the helicopter.  Your job is to shoot down the enemies as you are flown through footage of New York streets, the Statue of Liberty, the Atlantic Ocean, Italy, the Grand Canyon and finally, the treacherous corners and return fire of the enemy's stronghold on Easter Island.There is no background music to go along with the sound effects.  The levels are fairly short with a total game run through possible in about 20 minutes.</plot>

					<plot>In this game you are a visiting Earthman, caught in the war between ancient enemies. After you crashed, you joined your rescuers in their war for survival. You are the blue side; your enemies are colored red. You control a gigantic battle-robot, called a Zoid, to attack and defeat other Zoids.The action takes place from within the cockpit. You have to learn a new way of looking at the world, as your only contact with outside is through the instrument panels of the Zoid. This is not intuitive--it takes some reading, some experimentation, and lots of practice.What you see on the screen while playing is the cockpit control panels.  The computer displays your health and the health of your battle robot both visually and audibly.  You see your heartbeat and the bot has a similar heartbeat.  You also hear you heartbeats, and these tell you how your combined overall health is.Other features of the cockpit include a radar-style map that shows your Zoid in relation to the world around you.  The map includes terrain features, and anything your instruments pick up is put on the map.  All your game controls are displayed around the map, the railgun, shields, jamming, missiles, and general information panels.</plot>

You are the blue side; your enemies are colored red. You control a gigantic battle-robot, called a Zoid, to attack and defeat other Zoids.The action takes place from within the cockpit. You have to learn a new way of looking at the world, as your only contact with outside is through the instrument panels of the Zoid. This is not intuitive--it takes some reading, some experimentation, and lots of practice.What you see on the screen while playing is the cockpit control panels.  The computer displays your health and the health of your battle robot both visually and audibly.  You see your heartbeat and the bot has a similar heartbeat.  You also hear you heartbeats, and these tell you how your combined overall health is.Other features of the cockpit include a radar-style map that shows your Zoid in relation to the world around you.  The map includes terrain features, and anything your instruments pick up is put on the map.  All your game controls are displayed around the map, the railgun, shields, jamming, missiles, and general information panels.</plot>

					<plot>Sequel to the successful shoot 'm up Laydock. Again two jet fighters go on a joint mission, each space ship managed and controlled by a different player. The ships can be docked side-by-side or end-to-end for greater fire and fighting power. When docked one player is the pilot and the other is the weapons officer. But this game can also be played by a single player. When you progress in the game you can select more advance weapons systems to fight the over 50 different enemy characters. Compared with its predecessor there is not much changed only better graphics, more detailed backgrounds and inter level animations.</plot>

All the basic rules of volleyball are implemented, but few moves are available. The graphics are plain but with humourous animations such as players being thrown back when receiving the ball.</plot>

You start in front of the dance then must jump over or on bullies. Do not let them touch you head on or you lose a life. Also watch for toy planes that will dive at you. When you are in front of a building, jump at the windows to open them. You must find your father, who will then follow you. Next, find your mother and lead your father to her. They will both follow you so you lead them to the dance. This ends the round. The next round will have more buildings to search and tougher bullies, like some that leap to catch you in mid-air.</plot>

When you are in front of a building, jump at the windows to open them. You must find your father, who will then follow you. Next, find your mother and lead your father to her. They will both follow you so you lead them to the dance. This ends the round. The next round will have more buildings to search and tougher bullies, like some that leap to catch you in mid-air.</plot>

					<plot>In Banana, you are a round little thing on the Amazonas river, hunted by the man-eating Boconda tribe. A bit like Q*Bert, you jump around on stones in the river. Jumping is done by placing a cursor, with limited range, above a stone. If you don't place it right above the stone, you instead jump into the water. This isn't necessarily lethal, since you can jump up on adjacent stones, or you can go with the flow, as long as you take care not to pulled by the strong current into a spot where there are no stones to seek refuge on. It is also in the water that you will catch bananas coming down the stream.Bananas are necessary to get rid of the Bocondas; they can be placed on top of stones, and if a Boconda tries to jump at you, they will land on a banana and slip into the river where they are swept away. They are smart, though, so you will need to trick them into jumping onto your boobytrapped stones. Instead of tricking them, you can also swim to the river shore, pick up stones on the shore and throw them at the Bocondas to make them fall off their stones.</plot>

					<plot>Bandits are holding up a bank and have taken people hostage, and as a gunslinger, it's your job to shoot them. The bank has 12 doors, and the bandits are behind each one of them. When they pull a gun out at you when you open a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If you shoot them too early (ie: before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair, and you won't score any points, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives. If you waste too much time, a bandit will come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. If you're lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person will throw his/her hands up, saying &amp;quot;I haven't got anything&amp;quot;. That's when they will be replaced by bandits. Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of gold coins.There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what round you're on, you can shoot so many bandits before time runs out.</plot>

					<plot>A dictator took the control of a fortress on the island of Kuhn-Lin.The player's mission is to storm the island and recapture it. This takes place over the course of six different sequences. The first sequence is Aerial Reconnaissance, where the fleet must be moved directly past the enemy or into a hidden passage to trigger another, optional stage. In this Hidden Passage sequence, the player will have to maneuver around mines and torpedoes. Successfully completing it gives a surprise advantage in the following General Quarters sequence, where the player controls anti-aircraft guns shooting down enemy aircraft.The next sequence is named Battle Stations and the player must aim and fire heavy guns to hit enemy ships before they inflict too much damage and eventually sink the player's own vessels.  Following this battle, the fleet must be maneuvered to the beach. Upon reaching the Beach-Head level, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire and obstacles while driving. In the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.The port for C16 and Plus/4 computers only contains the General Quarters, Battle Stations and Final Battle sequences.</plot>

					<plot>Beamrider is a 3D arcade action game. You control a beam riding spaceship on a mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams. You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers. After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occasionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</plot>

					<plot>In this game, players control Rodger the Dodger (aka: Blagger), a burglar whose task is to collect a series of keys in a certain location, then use them to open the safe. Blagger must perform these tasks under a time limit while avoiding hazards such as cacti, cars, aliens, mad hatters, giant mouths, and chinamen. Blagger has no weapon to shoot these, but must rely on his jumping skills. He loses a life if he comes into contact with a hazard or falls long distances, or if he runs out of time. As usual, the game ends when all lives are lost. If Blagger successfully grabs the keys and makes his way to the safe, he proceeds to the next location.</plot>

					<plot>Boggy '84 is one of those games of which countless numbers were made in the early eighties during the homecomputer boom. It is slightly similar to Mappy or Space Panic but without the refinements of said games.You are a man who must collect a set of keys on a level with several floors. You can jump between floors using springboards, which gives you an advantage over your enemies, who must use the ladders to climb between floors. You must also use those in order to descend to a lower floor, mind you. Later levels add touches such as a a ski slope which you must ascend while avoiding the baddies. Hitting them from below will put them out of action, though.</plot>

					<plot>Congo Bongo is an arcade platform game similar in many ways to Donkey Kong, but with an isometric perspective. The player takes control of a safari hunter who is searching for an ape named Bongo, determined to punish him for setting the hunter's tent on fire. The game consists of four one-screen stages, each with an objective to jump on platforms and reach the top. Various animals will try to stop the protagonist: for example, in the first level a large gorilla throws coconuts at him. The hero has no offensive abilities and must jump or otherwise avoid enemy attacks. Stages may contain obstacles or hazardous spots that would kill off the main character.</plot>

The power-up system is rather big and unlike that of Hudson, including items that make you invisible, invert directions, slow-downs and most of all money.

					<plot>The second of the Bomberman series released for the MSX platform. Bomberman is a single player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</plot>

					<plot>The second of the Bomberman series released for the MSX platform. Bomberman is a single player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</plot>

					<plot>The Brick is an Arkanoid clone embodied in the interior of a mechanic system. As such, you will have to help the racket (in this case, a nut), to impulse the ball in order to break as much bricks as possible, although there would be others that will be indestructible by your hit. To make your work more complex, there will be some flying enemies that will modify the trajectory of your ball and in the worst of the cases even shot at you, thus reducing your energy bar. In order to avoid being defeated by these creatures, you have one laser which just one projectile that recharges itself occasionally, so you will have to use it wisely too.</plot>

					<plot>As the title implies, this is a game about breaking into banks, as well as a Break-Out clone.Each level is a bank, consisting of several rooms. You can only leave a room after your ball hits a key. As a burgler, you are symbolised by a pair of eyes, on top of which a paddle rests. Similarly to Woody Pop, parts of the bottom of the screen is covered up, so that you need not guard the ball as much as in other games. Unlike most Break-Out clones, you can move freely over the entire screen so as to hit the ball at the perfect spot. If you miss the ball and it passes through the void at the bottom, it falls back into the earlier rooms, just like in the Amiga classic, Poing. If you catch it there, you can send it back to the room your were in. In the last room of each bank, you should hit the money that is in there, before you hit the square with a calculator, which will calculate your score for that bank. Later vaults feature a bell which must not be hit, or it will wake a guardian that will hunt you across the screen.As in all post-Arkanoids, powerups are available, in the shape of a circle that bounces across the screen, all the while changing colours. Depending on which colour it is when you pick it up with your paddle, you get one bonus out of a range which corresponds to the basics of most games in the genre, such as wider paddle, sticky paddle, multiball and firepower.</plot>

					<plot>In Breakout, there is a wall of bricks along the top of the screen and your goal is to destroy the entire wall one brick at a time! To do this, you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen which is used to reflect a bouncing ball into the bricks. When the ball hits a brick, it will destroy it. You start with five balls, and the game ends when all five fall off the bottom of the screen. Also included are several game variations, including breakthru (the ball will go straight through bricks instead of bouncing back), timed breakout (you have a time limit to gain as many points as you can), and invisible breakout (the bricks are only visible for a short while after one of them is hit).  Other variations allow you to catch the ball or control the direction of the ball.</plot>

Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders. On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you should watch out for them.

Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; any other ingredient below it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud that will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.</plot>

Your goal is to destroy the other three cars by crashing into them on the side. A head-on collision has no effect.When all three other cars have been taken out of competition you advance to the next level.In some levels the arena can contain a ramp, which can be used to jump on other cars or a pond in the middle in which you can try to push the other cars to take them out of the competition.All this has to be done before you run out of fuel. If any fuel left then you'll receive bonus points.</plot>

Remember to avoid the jugs that emit fire. You must do this for 100 meters.Stunt #2: Walk the tightrope for 70 meters, avoiding the monkeys that get in your way. Jump the cyan monkeys for 500 points.Stunt #3: Roll on a ball for 80 meters, jumping from ball to ball. You can move balls backwards if the target is too close to make a successful jump. Avoid contact with the ground.Stunt #4: Ride a horse for 200 meters, bouncing on trampolines along the way. Be careful not to miss the jump or go over the tops of trampolines. You can speed up or slow down the horse.Stunt #5: Finally, trapeze from swing to swing for 50 meters. If you miss, make sure that you land on the platforms below so you bounce back on a swing.Once you have completed all five stunts, you have to do them again and hopefully, more points will be awarded.</plot>

					<plot>The Franciscan monk Noni wants to join the Vitigudina order. To judge his valor, the order asks for a test of virtue: the monk has to collect weapons and use them to exorcise all the demons of a village.Temptations is a Spanish flick-screen platform game. The game is divided in a series of levels, each with a series of screens. The player controls the monk's movements with the ARROW KEYS or the JOYSTICK. Pressing the SPACE BAR or the FIRE BUTTON shoots the projectile weapon he is carrying. The friar is killed if he touches the demons or some of the screen objects. His movement has inertia: after landing on a platform he usually keeps sliding forward (that is something that must be taken on account when planning how to move from one screen to the other). Shooting choice spots on the screen reveals hidden power-ups that can be collected, and some screens require the use of a specific power-up to reach their exit. The game starts with 10 lives and has no form of saving progress.</plot>

					<plot>Winning entry in the MSXdev'05 coding competition, The Cure is an arcade jump&amp;amp;run heavily influenced by Konami's classic Vampire Killer.The hero, who does look a bit like The Cure's Robert Smith dressed in Mega Man's clothes, starts out in a demonic landscape on his quest to rid the land of the most evil One and his minions. After traversing the cursed landscape, you enter a castle, which will be directly recognisable to anyone who has played Castlevania.Equipped only with a whip, the hero must choose his battles. However, strewn across the levels are keys which will open chests containing bonuses which will render (short-term) invincibility, lengthen your whip or grant you a subweapon, such as a throwing dagger or an hourglass to freeze time momentarily. Subweapons consume hearts, which can be found not only in chests, but by destroying monsters or whipping down candles from the castle's walls.The Cure features a soundtrack with several pieces throughout, swap-screen &amp;quot;scrolling&amp;quot; and both hardware and plotted sprites.</plot>

					<plot>Winning entry in the MSXdev'05 coding competition, The Cure is an arcade jump&amp;amp;run heavily influenced by Konami's classic Vampire Killer.The hero, who does look a bit like The Cure's Robert Smith dressed in Mega Man's clothes, starts out in a demonic landscape on his quest to rid the land of the most evil One and his minions. After traversing the cursed landscape, you enter a castle, which will be directly recognisable to anyone who has played Castlevania.Equipped only with a whip, the hero must choose his battles. However, strewn across the levels are keys which will open chests containing bonuses which will render (short-term) invincibility, lengthen your whip or grant you a subweapon, such as a throwing dagger or an hourglass to freeze time momentarily. Subweapons consume hearts, which can be found not only in chests, but by destroying monsters or whipping down candles from the castle's walls.The Cure features a soundtrack with several pieces throughout, swap-screen &amp;quot;scrolling&amp;quot; and both hardware and plotted sprites.</plot>

					<plot>The subtitle &amp;quot;The moving puzzle game&amp;quot; should be interpreted literally; this is a puzzle game where the picture on the puzzle pieces are constantly animated. This can make piecing together the pieces quite difficult, or at least call for strategies not used in conventional puzzles.There are ten puzzles to choose from, and these can be divided into anything from 2x2 to 12x8 pieces. The pieces are not only scattered, they may also be turned upside down. As you play the puzzle, your score starts to count down, and the rate of the countdown is heightened when you execute moves, turn the pieces or use the special features which will reveal a glimpse of the finished puzzle, automatically lay out pieces, or halt the animation. If the score reaches zero, the game is over.</plot>

					<plot>Nine holes of chaotic top-viewed ricochets and hazards make up this early Crazy Golf game. They can be skipped for a score of 12 if you get stuck. There are no moving hazards, so gameplay is essentially a golf-themed precise positioning puzzle. Furthering this aspect, it does not matter what pace the ball is at when it reaches the hole (it never rebounds out of it) and that rebounds are always at precise 90-degree angles without taking pace out of the ball.Sixteen shot angles and sixteen shot paces are available. The first hole is simply a row of vertically-placed barriers with only small gaps at each end, but later holes include randomly-placed ball-sized blocks, curved barriers almost enclosing the hole, and square blockades leaving only narrow corridors to play (bounce, more effectively) the ball through. The final hole combines all these for a par-12 challenge.</plot>

					<plot>Three star stones have been hidden in locked treasure chests within a castle inhabited by dragons, guards, spiders, tarantulas wizards and the like. Battle Hero Redham is brave enough to take on such a task, and it is only by obtaining these that he can rescue Taleria.Although Redham is armed with a small supply of daggers (more can be collected), these can only be fired while he is stationary, and the graphics are drawn large so that not much is seen on each screen. This means that a lot of advance route-planning is required, although most creatures can be killed by landing on their heads (horizontal contact with them is however fatal). The tarantulas are perhaps the deadliest foe, as they move so quickly. Treasure chests are located along the route, containing various potions and poisons as well as extra weapons.</plot>

A small radar at the bottom of the screen shows the enemies' position. Fuel and rockets are limited, but there are several landing platforms where the jet can be refueled and resupplied. Before the jet is able to land however, it needs to be brought to a full halt right above the platform, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. Landing platforms can also be destroyed if they are bombed or enemy planes crash into them. As the game progresses, enemies attack in increasingly large and difficult waves.</plot>

					<plot>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points. </plot>

					<plot>Dungeon Hunter is a First Person Shooter dungeon horror game that is played using a gun joystick. There were three different levels, or settings, that you play in. You travel your way through forests, dungeons, and caverns, and some graveyards at the end of a level. Each setting offered a slightly different variety of enemies. Enemies encountered are of the standard type found in most early games of the genre, such as bats and skeletons.  To help navigate through the maze-like levels, a map is available for access. The entire game is played using the gun joystick so that movement is also done by shooting on the arrows onscreen.</plot>

The enemies' goal is to destroy the energy centers of the city, and the brave pilot must stop them at all costs. The gameplay is similar to that of Falcon Patrol: player-controlled jet moves in four directions, destroying enemies with missiles, and needs to recharge fuel and ammunition at specific points, where it becomes particularly vulnerable to enemy attacks.</plot>

The ships can be docked side-by-side or end-to-end for greater fire and fighting power. When docked one player is the pilot and the other is the weapons officer. But this game can also be played by a single player. When you progress in the game you can select more advance weapons systems to fight the over 50 different enemy characters. Compared with its predecessor there is not much changed only better graphics, more detailed backgrounds and inter level animations.</plot>

					<plot>Dragon Slayer is commonly considered one of the progenitors of the action RPG genre. The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.The player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive. The knight is able to cast magic spells, though they are mostly used outside of combat, for example breaking walls, teleporting, or creating a map of the area.</plot>

					<plot>Dragon Slayer is commonly considered one of the progenitors of the action RPG genre. The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.The player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive. The knight is able to cast magic spells, though they are mostly used outside of combat, for example breaking walls, teleporting, or creating a map of the area.</plot>

					<plot>Driller Tanks features a side-on view of the tank you control, which is submerged in a maze full of nasties known as Mammuts and Skorks. The aim is to first shoot them, then run them over, within a limited period of time before they wake up and reactivate. You must walk through a particular section of maze to make it accessible for this, as any shot fired into the initial blue barriers will have no effect. At all times you must watch to ensure that none of the Mammuts reach the palace by travelling to the top of the screen. The Skorks are less harmful, but contact with them in their unfrozen state is still fatal, and they refill areas you have cleared.</plot>

					<plot>The general concept is that up to five players can play on any of the 30 bowling lanes available; simulating the concept of being in a bowling league. Players can change their lane positioning, determine how strong the throw is, and even make the ball go through various curves (or even through a straight ball into the pins). Each player character can be either male or female with options for bowling ball weights ranging from 7 pounds or 3.2 kilograms to 15 pounds or 6.8 kilograms.</plot>

					<plot>Eagles 5 is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up loosely based on the Japanese anime series Gatchaman. Characters from the anime are featured on the game's cover and in the background story; however, in the game itself the player controls a spaceship flying through deep space levels with identical background. The ship is protected by a shield, which effectively grants it a HP bar. Power-ups that upgrade the ship's weaponry can be found in the stages. However, the weapon reverts to its default shape when the ship is hit by the enemy. There are no continues in the game: when the ship's hit points are depleted, the game must be restarted from the beginning.</plot>

The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only colored red. It is up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him.You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). Luckily for you Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers.There are other types of obstacles in the levels, as well, such as water and Emerald Framers (green blocks that Lolo may push around freely).</plot>

Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:Shooting them with his gun.Kicking them by jumping onto them.Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.Crushing them with an elevator.Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</plot>

There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</plot>

					<plot>The Franciscan monk Noni wants to join the Vitigudina order. To judge his valor, the order asks for a test of virtue: the monk has to collect weapons and use them to exorcise all the demons of a village.Temptations is a Spanish flick-screen platform game. The game is divided in a series of levels, each with a series of screens. The player controls the monk's movements with the ARROW KEYS or the JOYSTICK. Pressing the SPACE BAR or the FIRE BUTTON shoots the projectile weapon he is carrying. The friar is killed if he touches the demons or some of the screen objects. His movement has inertia: after landing on a platform he usually keeps sliding forward (that is something that must be taken on account when planning how to move from one screen to the other). Shooting choice spots on the screen reveals hidden power-ups that can be collected, and some screens require the use of a specific power-up to reach their exit. The game starts with 10 lives and has no form of saving progress.</plot>

					<plot>The first title in the Bomberman series, released as Eric and the Floaters in the UK, introduces the gameplay concept the series is known for, but otherwise bears little resemblance to the later, more famous entries, with series mascot the White Bomberman nowhere in sight.The game includes 20 single-screen levels. Each consists of a regular grid of indestructible walls, randomly placed destructible walls, and enemies (Floaters) moving between them. The goal of the Bomberman (or Eric in the UK version) is to kill all Floaters present in order to advance to the next stage. There is only one Floater in the first level, but their numbers rise in later stages. To destroy them, Bomberman can drop a bomb at the push of a button, which goes off after a few seconds, hopefully vanquishing an enemy and not himself. If a bomb destroys a wall, hidden items may be revealed, including a treasure chest to be collected for bonus points. The Floaters change between various states indicated by their color, with some states netting higher score for their destruction then others. When they turn red, they follow Bomberman around, which can be used to lure them into strategically placed bombs. Some levels add an extra twist by making Bomberman drop his bombs automatically instead of manually.</plot>

					<plot>The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. &amp;quot;When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come...&amp;quot; And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil knight Garland, and then the real journey begins.Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. He also gives the characters names. In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run). Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons-style spell slots, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.</plot>

					<releasedate>01/01/1984</releasedate>
					<studio>Pony Canyon</studio>
					<plot>Fruit Panic is a platform game with some similarities to Mappy, albeit single-screen like Bomb Jack. Controlling Walky, a yellow ball with legs, you must pick up all fruit strewn across the platforms, while hunted by the Nyankys. Walky can't jump between platforms, so the only way to reach another platform, and more fruit, is to walk off the platform and go to one of the trampolines placed on the left and right of the screen. During his walk, Walky is a prone target for the Nyankys, who will hunt him from all directions. Walky's only defence is to drop on the head of a Nyanky, and his ability to lay bombs, of which he has a limited supply. Only one bomb may be laid at any time, preventing you from covering the screen in bombs. Jumping too many times on the trampoline will make it burst, costing Walky one life. When all fruit are picked, the game proceeds to the next level, with new platforms and another kind of fruit.Fruit Panic has been remade in 1990 as the Game Boy game Tasmania Story.</plot>

					<studio>Zemina</studio>
					<plot>Flashpoint is a Tetris variant. The various shapes of the falling blocks and their rotation are identical to the prototype. What makes the game different from a standard Tetris clone is its objective. Each stage already contains a pattern of blocks, usually arranged as symbols, characters, or other images. Among these blocks are several bombs. The goal is to make these bombs detonate by clearing out the rows they are in. Once all the bombs have been detonated, the stage &amp;quot;explodes&amp;quot;, and the player advances to the next one. The speed of the falling blocks gradually increases if it takes the player too long to complete a single stage. However, it reverts to the default with each new stage. There are 90 stages altogether. Two-player gameplay is available as well.</plot>

					<plot>Your task in this arcade game is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away from their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</plot>

					<plot>Front Line is a vertically scrolling action game. Your mission is to infiltrate enemy territory and destroy their fortress. To reach the fortress, you will have to make your way through varied and dangerous terrain. Jungles, deserts, brush, and rocks all slow your progress, plus each area has numerous enemy fighters and tanks trying to stop you. To help get past these obstacles, you are armed with a machine gun and grenades; at some points in the game you may even come across an abandoned tank which you can control to increase your odds of survival. When you reach the end of the level and successfully destroy the fortress, the game will repeat at a higher level of difficulty. Gameplay is for one or two players, and four different skill levels are available.</plot>

					<plot>Fruit Panic is a platform game with some similarities to Mappy, albeit single-screen like Bomb Jack. Controlling Walky, a yellow ball with legs, you must pick up all fruit strewn across the platforms, while hunted by the Nyankys. Walky can't jump between platforms, so the only way to reach another platform, and more fruit, is to walk off the platform and go to one of the trampolines placed on the left and right of the screen. During his walk, Walky is a prone target for the Nyankys, who will hunt him from all directions. Walky's only defence is to drop on the head of a Nyanky, and his ability to lay bombs, of which he has a limited supply. Only one bomb may be laid at any time, preventing you from covering the screen in bombs. Jumping too many times on the trampoline will make it burst, costing Walky one life. When all fruit are picked, the game proceeds to the next level, with new platforms and another kind of fruit.Fruit Panic has been remade in 1990 as the Game Boy game Tasmania Story.</plot>

That's really it to the game -- new levels bring different backgrounds (battleship, castle and space base) with corresponding enemies (pirates, knights and aliens), but essentially the same gameplay.This game is based on the comic book hero.</plot>

					<studio>Activision</studio>
					<plot>Based on the 1984 film of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call to &amp;quot;bust&amp;quot; any ghost hauntings. They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated &amp;quot;proton packs&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ghost traps&amp;quot;, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the &amp;quot;PK level&amp;quot; in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.Ghostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for &amp;quot;ghost alarms&amp;quot;, as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).As the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</plot>

					<plot>Based on the British TV series of the same name, you play dodgy businessman Arthur Daley and your aim is to amass as much money as possible in two weeks by buying and selling merchandise of dubious provenance. Assisting you is your bodyguard/minder Terry McCann, while the policeman Sgt. Chisholm is ready to fine you if he catches you with stolen goods.You start the game with two thousand pounds and some inventory in your storage locker. Some of the goods may have already been promised to someone, and just need to be delivered. Other goods are expected, but have yet to be collected from the supplier. Goods can be bought and sold by visiting individual sellers, or the Winchester pub where a variety of wheeler-dealer types hang out. Each character present at the time is represented graphically in the top half of the screen and is associated with a number. By pressing that number (quickly, as there is a time limit) you can initiate conversation with that character. If you fail to select a character before the time limit, a random character may start speaking with you. All dialogue involves buying items from them (using text commands like &amp;quot;I WANT&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;HOW MUCH&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;OFFER&amp;quot;) or selling items to them.Once a deal has been agreed, the goods need to be moved. Your minder, Terry McCann can assist with this, and can be found at the Winchester, or in his flat (although he will tend to be uncooperative after working hours). He can be asked to collect or deliver items. If you are meeting with a dealer who might be upset with you because you have sold them poor quality merchandise, you can ask Terry to &amp;quot;MINDER&amp;quot; and he will accompany you to prevent violence (to you). Terry can also &amp;quot;DUMP&amp;quot; goods if they are stolen and you have the law breathing down your neck, so need to just get rid of them. You can tell goods are stolen because you will be questioned about them at odd times by Sgt. Chisholm. If he catches you with the goods at the storage locker, you will need to pay a hefty fine.</plot>

					<plot>In Goody you are a thief with a mission to break into a Spanish bank. In order to accomplish that you need the appropriate tools, such as a torch and pincers. On the way toward the bank you must avoid policemen, gorillas, kung-fu experts, women sweeping the street, paper airplanes, and other hazards. The game is a platformer with light puzzle-solving which requires usage of the correct object in the correct place, similar to Jet Set Willy.</plot>

					<plot>While this MSX version of The Goonies borrows the basic concept from the Famicom (NES) version, it features completely different levels and enemies. Rather than play Mikey and save the remaining Goonies, you play as Sloth who must rescue all the Goonies, meaning you need to rescue seven Goonies per stage instead of just one so the stages are significantly longer and more complicated. To open doors you need to use keys instead of bombs, and you can only carry one key at a time. There's also an experience meter that increases every time you kill an enemy.</plot>

					<studio>Compile</studio>
					<plot>Guardic is a top-down 2d shooter based on the classic premise of pitting a single starfighter against a horde of enemies with the fate of the galaxy at hand. A particularly interesting touch in Guardic is that instead of fighting through a scrolling field filled with enemies, the game places your ship in &amp;quot;rooms&amp;quot; with a fixed amount of opponents that take up the most part of the screen. After defeating every enemy on screen you advance to the next room and so on... Power ups are not activated until you reach the next room (with some exceptions) and even then you have to choose which ones to activate before you enter the fight, which gives the game an additional strategic touch.</plot>

					<studio>Pony Canyon</studio>
					<plot>Deviating slightly from Compile's usual vertically scrolling fashion, Gulkave is a rather orthodox horizontal shooter. Flying across  or inside  a parallax scrolling landscape, your spaceship must singlehandedly take out eight fortresses. In your way stand enemy spaceships that either try to crush you or fire at you, as well as some asteroids thrown in for good measure. For each hit you take, your ship is not destroyed. Instead, you have a power (barrier) bar that decreases gradually until you finally lose a ship. At the end of each level, bonus points are given according to your remaining barrier. Losing a ship means you lose all your weapons upgrades as well. As usual with a shooter from this maker, the powerups come in the shape of numbered pods that are released from Zanac-style blocks. Different upgrades give higher shot counts, more simultaneous bullets or bigger energy waves. At certain score intervals, you're granted bonus ships.The game was released for both the MSX and Sega's SG-1000 console, the latter version having two levels less.</plot>

The objective is to collect a bounty by finding and eliminating wanted criminals that are harassing the town. Innocent bystanders will point to the direction of the criminal, shooting them will result in a fine reducing your score. A horse can be obtained to speed up the chase. Once the wanted criminal is encountered, the game again switches to a first person cross hair view, where the first to draw will be the winner. Taking out the criminal will give you a reward that helps you with future expenditures as the cost of ammo and horses changes as the game goes along. Your final tally will become your score at the game's end.</plot>

They are separated at the shoulders but capable of joining together to maximize their abilities in some situations (but reduce them in others, so they can be split again).The game is presented from an isometric perspective, and presents the characters with a number of puzzles involving switches, jumps and climbs. The levels are 3 dimensional, and the characters must collect crowns as they progress. Objects can be picked up and manipulated as necessary.</plot>

					<plot>Two distinct characters called Mr Head and Mr Heels are  played in this arcade adventure. They are separated at the shoulders but capable of joining together to maximize their abilities in some situations (but reduce them in others, so they can be split again).The game is presented from an isometric perspective, and presents the characters with a number of puzzles involving switches, jumps and climbs. The levels are 3 dimensional, and the characters must collect crowns as they progress. Objects can be picked up and manipulated as necessary.</plot>

					<plot>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!). If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</plot>

There are 30 screens, most of them filled with hazards trying to block (like barrels) or destroy (mines and aliens) your bomb. The perspective and guidance concept are not the game's only original features; there are 4 more bombs with you, representing your extra lives - pushing you forward on your mission. If these other Vortons are destroyed, one of your extra lives is lost without the player being able to use it.</plot>

					<plot>You are Chumy, the mouse. You live in the sewer, and you are hungry. Luckily, the sewer is filled with cheese, only it is guarded by menacing creatures such as rabbits, turtles and bats.In order to get his cheese, Chumy must go between platforms connected by ladders, all the time avoiding the other creatures. Luckily, Chumy can jump very far, across and above the nasties. Chumy also has an arsenal of cans to throw at the enemies. Most die after just one hit, whereas others are more impervious to attacks. The rabbits are particularly dangerous, since they may pounce at you unexpectedly, they being able to jump just as far as Chumy. When Chumy eats cheese (or bombs or biscuits), he moves slower due to the extra weight. When the mouse has fed on all the cheese, it can take the dust chute down from the top level to the bottom, and make its way to the exit and on to the next level. Control Chumy with the cursor keys and X for jumping, C for throwing.This game has also been included, in a slightly revised form, on Compile's Disk Station #0.</plot>

The player has to explore vast wilderness areas, descending into dungeons and eliminating enemies on the way. Combat system is similar to the one implemented in Ys series: attacking enemies requires the player to &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; into them, at the same time preventing them from attacking the playable character from the sides and the back. The player can change between defensive and offensive stances by pressing a single button. Magic spells can also be used to dispose of the enemies. The player character grows stronger and gains better parameters as he advances in the game.</plot>

					<plot>Hydlide II: Shine Of Darkness is an action RPG, and the second installment in the Hydlide series.In a different space a wonderful world existed, called Fairy Land, which was dominated by swords and magic after the times of domination by monsters and evil had ended. The people of Fairy Land were intoxicated with peace. At that time an incident occurred. A Consciousness filled with evil awoke and it created new monsters, brought the dead back to life, and wanted to dominate Fairy Land again. The monks were one of the first who noticed this and warned the people about it but they didn't listen and left the monks disappointed. The monks prayed to God and asked Him if there was a Savior. God, impressed by the monks prayers warped the space-time of Fairy Land with the human world and selected an innocent boy who lived there.The player controls the innocent boy, who must roam the lands of Fairy Land and free it from evil. The player has to create a character before beginning the quest, customizing his parameters - life, strength, and magic. As in the previous game, the player slays enemies by &amp;quot;bumping&amp;quot; into them or using magical spells. It is possible to change between attacking and defensive stances on the fly. The hero can become stronger and gain additional powers. In the villages there are shops where the protagonist can buy and sell weapons, armor, and items. </plot>

					<plot>Hydlide II: Shine Of Darkness is an action RPG, and the second installment in the Hydlide series.In a different space a wonderful world existed, called Fairy Land, which was dominated by swords and magic after the times of domination by monsters and evil had ended. The people of Fairy Land were intoxicated with peace. At that time an incident occurred. A Consciousness filled with evil awoke and it created new monsters, brought the dead back to life, and wanted to dominate Fairy Land again. The monks were one of the first who noticed this and warned the people about it but they didn't listen and left the monks disappointed. The monks prayed to God and asked Him if there was a Savior. God, impressed by the monks prayers warped the space-time of Fairy Land with the human world and selected an innocent boy who lived there.The player controls the innocent boy, who must roam the lands of Fairy Land and free it from evil. The player has to create a character before beginning the quest, customizing his parameters - life, strength, and magic. As in the previous game, the player slays enemies by &amp;quot;bumping&amp;quot; into them or using magical spells. It is possible to change between attacking and defensive stances on the fly. The hero can become stronger and gain additional powers. In the villages there are shops where the protagonist can buy and sell weapons, armor, and items. </plot>

					<plot>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called &amp;quot;The Force&amp;quot;, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</plot>

					<plot>Jagur: Golden Triangle is something as unusual as a cross between Commando and an action RPG such as Ys or Hydlide.You start out with your character Jef jumping off a boat somewhere in the Golden Triangle between Laos, Burma and Thailand, presumably to fight drug lords. A typical Commando or Ikari-styled mission. The town Jef enters is inhabited by gangsters of all kinds who shoot at you. Thankfully, some of the locals are quite friendly, offering to sell you drugs (of the medical kind?), food or even weapons. Other offer you vital information. The clues you are given lead you to the right house, where you may find a friend who has previously been captured. Your quest is then to find the right bribe for your mate to be released. The puzzles begin in the simplest fashion, so as not to interfere with the action aspects of the game. Soon, all five members of the team are gathered, and the quest may go on farther into the triangle, where opposition will be fiercer and the puzzles harder. Thankfully, slain enemies will often drop munitions or money, so that you may keep your arsenal updated and your team alive, not to mention bribing the right people.Though featuring a lot of action, Jagur 5 has enough RPG emphasis to actually have an experience meter. A strategic element involves choosing the right team leader and the right formation to handle different tasks. Instead of magic spells, bombs, grenades or bazookas are used, and medical supplies replace magic potions, making Jagur 5 one of few RPGs which don't involve magic, though it may not count as a proper RPG in everyone's eyes.</plot>

					<plot>This arcade game is a cross between Breakout and Space Invaders. Player controls an electromechanical robot, who walks along the top of a wall consisting of bricks and jumps on it. A line of bugs is coming to him from the bottom of the screen in vertical direction, while the bomb is flying in horizontal direction in the center. Bugs may be killed by jumping on the wall, which results in a brick falling from its bottom. The number of jumps is equal to the bottom brick's distance from the robot. Flying bomb may eliminate the brick until it reaches the bug, but if the bug is killed, its bad or good soul will fly to the top, where robot may collect it and make influence on his mood. After the bug is eliminated, another one will start to crawl from the bottom. There is a snail moving in horizontal direction at the very bottom of the screen, which is mostly covered by the bugs crawling to the top, and it may be hit by brick in case of success also. The player is transferred to another level after necessary quantity of the bugs is killed. But beware! Robot's energy is exhausted, when bug is crawling upon him, and the robot becomes non-functional if the bugs reached the very top of the screen or if the robot falls off the wall.</plot>

					<plot>A girl named Kumiko is spending a vacation with her younger sister Nagisa in Karuizawa, a popular tourist destination in Japan. The vacation turns into nightmare when Nagisa doesn't return home from the local supermarket. Kumiko receives a strange phone call later that evening, and decides to call the police. However, the authorities seem unable to solve the mystery, and Kumiko's boyfriend decides to conduct the investigation by himself.Karuizawa Ykai Annai is an adventure game that relies on exploration and information-gathering rather than on puzzle-solving. Individual locations are displayed as still screens viewed from first-person perspective; however, the player can also navigate the protagonist on a top-down map. The player is presented with a large menu of commands, which are for the most part identical on every screen. Some of these commands can be combined with objects chosen from a menu.</plot>

					<plot>The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</plot>

					<studio>Ultimate Play The Game</studio>
					<plot>Our hero must reach Melkhior, a somewhat eccentric wizard who is the only one who can save him. As with most Ultimate titles of the day, reaching him is a long and treacherous challenge, involving both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each screen requires thorough planning and precise navigation. The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later Head Over Heels, using monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of eschewing straightforward instructions in favor of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts.</plot>

					<plot>Knightmare 2:Maze of Galious/Majou Densetsu 2:Daimashikyou Galious is a 
Japanese game which was released back in 1987 for MSX. It is a sequel to Knightmare. I've never played Knightmare 1 before. All I know is that it is a shooter type of game in which you play as 
Popolon who tried to rescue his wife Aphrodite from a villain named Hudnos. The
sequel takes place right after you rescued Aphrodite.  Now you play as both 
Popolon and Aphrodite, who will try to to rescue their future baby kidnapped 
by a dark priest named Galious. The gameplay is a mix between action and RPG.
You have the side-scrolling actions throughout six worlds and yet at the same
time there are some RPG elements included such as having to find certain items
to complete certain tasks. Maze of Galious stays true to its name with its huge
and sometimes confusing maze-like worlds to be explored.Majou Densetsu II: Daimashikyou Galious is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1987.</plot>

					<plot>Knightmare is a 1986 MSX vertical scrolling shooter computer game. The player is a knight, Popolon, who has to fight his way through several levels to defeat Hudnos and rescue Aphrodite.

Knightmare was an innovative upward-scrolling shoot 'em up game on the MSX system. The top-view graphics were considered very sophisticated for its time, similar to other MSX games such as Nemesis and Penguin Adventure.

In fact, in addition to movement, you only have a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (4 directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. Your goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up.. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</plot>

The player must construct and destroy blocks in order to access the key that opens the door to the next stage. As opposed to Solomon's Key, blocks can only be built diagonally upwards, like stairs. Deleted blocks can be used to trap wandering enemies. The protagonist can also wear armor that protects him from projectile attacks. </plot>

					<plot>Once there was only one continent in the world. It was populated by magicians. At first they lived in peace, using magic to make the land prosper. But soon they were divided into two groups: good and evil. The forces of vice were strong, and the benevolent magicians need the help of a lone warrior to venture into the castle of the evil magicians and defeat them.Legendly Knight is a Korean-made action game with platforming elements. The game consists of single-screen stages, most of which contain platform structures. The player-controlled knight can jump and attack enemies. The goal is to kill all the enemies on the screen, including bosses which are fought one-on-one.The knight has a health bar measured by hearts. He is armed with a small sword in the beginning, but later can find throwing weapons and magic spells. Items include armor, a scuba suit, health-restoring potions, and a ring that grants temporary invincibility. Keys must be obtained in order to access the boss room. All these items are invisible, and their exact location must be revealed by attacking spots in the stage. It is possible to find and equip glasses that would show the exact location of the keys.</plot>

					<plot>The aim of the game is to guide a ball through 50 levels of walls, barriers and general obstacles. You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings.There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random.The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape or disk.</plot>

					<plot>Lot Lot is a puzzle game. The goal of the game is of extreme simplicity. Manipulate the balls in such a way till they fall into the pits and generate points.The game has five pits: Out, 0 points, 10 points, 30 points and 50 points.Each level starts by giving the player a target score that has to be reached before the player can continue on to the next level.The screen is divided into sixteen sections. The walls of those sections randomly disappear and the balls will then drop or roll into the other section or a pit at the bottom of the screen.On the screen, there will be two arrows of which the second arrow follows the first one, but with a slight delay, and it stops at the same position as the first one.The arrows will start in an empty section of which one of the walls will soon disappear. To move the balls to the empty section move the first arrow to a section that is filled with balls end press the space bar or fire button. The balls will then be moved to the empty section. If both sections contain balls then the balls will be swapped accordingly.Now the goal is to manipulate the balls in such a way that they will  fall into the pits, thus generating points for the player.In the bottom left of the screen there is a section that has a thin red line at the bottom. Never move the balls in that section because if any balls enter that section a crab will appear and cut the red line with its razor sharp claws, causing the balls to disappear in the pit labeled 'OUT' and resulting in the player losing a life.</plot>

					<plot>This game is a ripoff of the classic arcade game Burgertime. You are a hamburger chef and you're out to build delicious hamburgers. As you run through the colorful maze assembling the ingredients, there is nothing that can stop you. Except maybe the menacing egg, hot dog and pickles that are out to ruin the meal! You can bury them under beef patties, lettuce and buns. Or, knock them out with pepper. To complete a level you have to build four burgers.</plot>

As you set off , you must miss the missiles that come up from the sea, and an enemy aircraft which flies from left to right at random times. When you do get to a stranded airman you release a rope by pressing the fire button or space bar, so that he can climb up to the helicopter. Once he is on board you must fly back to the air craft and drop him off to the ambulance,then do it all over again - there are 25 airmen to collect.</plot>

					<plot>You are Akineki Nakashima, a 17-year-old Japanese student and computer freak. You developed a program that allows you to communicate with demons via your computer and to summon them. To test your new program, you summon the Norse god Loki. Unfortunately, the newly summoned god kidnaps Yumiko, a girl who studies together with Nakashima. Japan becomes infested with demons, and now it's up to you to traverse the mazes of the demon realm and to rescue Yumiko.This version of Megami Tensei has little to do with the Famicom (NES) version (and with Megaten RPGs in general) gameplay-wise. It is an action game with RPG elements, in which you must fight your way through a series of mazes infested with demons, whom you must defeat in real time combat. You find many items and become stronger as the game progresses, but the emphasis of the game is not on character development but on action-oriented combat and exploration of the dungeons.</plot>

To test your new program, you summon the Norse god Loki. Unfortunately, the newly summoned god kidnaps Yumiko, a girl who studies together with Nakashima. Japan becomes infested with demons, and now it's up to you to traverse the mazes of the demon realm and to rescue Yumiko.This version of Megami Tensei has little to do with the Famicom (NES) version (and with Megaten RPGs in general) gameplay-wise. It is an action game with RPG elements, in which you must fight your way through a series of mazes infested with demons, whom you must defeat in real time combat. You find many items and become stronger as the game progresses, but the emphasis of the game is not on character development but on action-oriented combat and exploration of the dungeons.</plot>

					<plot>Mai is a little girl with cat ears who studies the art of magic. Unfortunately, she doesn't always do her homework, and sometimes loses control of her magical powers. This is precisely what happened one day, when she accidentally unleashed a magical spell upon terrified classmates. Now the poor girl is being hunted down by male and female students, teachers, and other people, and she has to fight for her life while perfecting her magic-casting skills.Mai is similar to the better-known Mad Monogatari games in many ways: it is a solo pseudo-3D first-person dungeon crawl; it casts a little innocent girl with magical powers as the heroine; it displays no numeric statistics (damage feedback, the heroine's progress, etc. are shown only graphically or with the help of text messages); it has an overall &amp;quot;cute&amp;quot; theme with comical animations. However, unlike Mad Monogatari, Mai contains graphical nudity and scenes with mild depiction of sexual situations.</plot>

					<plot>Mai is a little girl with cat ears who studies the art of magic. Unfortunately, she doesn't always do her homework, and sometimes loses control of her magical powers. This is precisely what happened one day, when she accidentally unleashed a magical spell upon terrified classmates. Now the poor girl is being hunted down by male and female students, teachers, and other people, and she has to fight for her life while perfecting her magic-casting skills.Mai is similar to the better-known Mad Monogatari games in many ways: it is a solo pseudo-3D first-person dungeon crawl; it casts a little innocent girl with magical powers as the heroine; it displays no numeric statistics (damage feedback, the heroine's progress, etc. are shown only graphically or with the help of text messages); it has an overall &amp;quot;cute&amp;quot; theme with comical animations. However, unlike Mad Monogatari, Mai contains graphical nudity and scenes with mild depiction of sexual situations.</plot>

					<plot>Made in the old Japanese top-down style, Monster Hunter is a straight-forward RPG with a few original twists. You, as a knight, find yourself in a foreign land, and must find the king to be granted passage out of the kingdom. Thus, you find yourself on a typical console RPG quest to find one person, help him find an item, let him tell you where to find another person who can tell you where to find item X, and so on.Outside of the major population centres are random encounters with monsters, which makes the game change to a battle screen. You can equip your character with new weapons and armours, and you have a range of magic spells available to you as well. Fighting is carried out in a peculiar manner, similar to certain golf games. You have a quickly rotating power bar, and pressing the button when it is at its highest makes your attack stronger.</plot>

					<plot>Mole is a whack-a-mole type of game where the objective is to hit on the head of colored moles as they emerge from 8 holes situated in cardinal and ordinal directions from the center of the field. However, the color of the mallet changes frequently and the player has to respond to it because hitting a mole of the same color as the mallet will result in decrease of the score bar. If the player is unable to fill the score in time (indicated by a timer bar), the game is lost. There are 9 difficulty levels, with higher difficulty featuring more frequent appearance of moles of the same color as the mallet, thus requiring more attention of the player.</plot>

					<plot>Mole Mole is a puzzle game in which the player has to navigate a rather anthropomorphic mole through top-down single-screen stages, with the goal of reaching the exit after having collected all the fruits on the screen.The mole can climb the stairs scattered around the levels, or dig tunnels in any direction except upwards. All the levels also include boulders, which will fall down if disturbed by the mole's burrowing activities. As opposed to  Boulder Dash variants, the boulders cannot kill the mole or harm him in any way; it is impossible to &amp;quot;die&amp;quot; in the game. However, unless the player calculates the moves with extreme precision, getting irrevocably stuck and restarting the level is a common occurrence.The player can start from any of the 45 levels, arranged in order of ascending difficulty. There is also an editor that allows the players to create their own levels.</plot>

					<plot>The follow-up to Mole Mole plays exactly like the original, which means that it is very close to Boulder Dash but at a slower pace, since each move requires planning, whereas falling boulders won't kill you. Three difficulty levels are on offer: Selections, Children and Experts. Your mole, while digging tunnels in the earth to collect each and every item on-screen before proceeding to the exit, can neither jump nor dig upwards, which is what makes careful planning of your tunnels necessary. To your aid, you have a map screen which shows the entire level in a zoomed-out format. The same screen is also used for the built-in level editor.</plot>

					<plot>In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</plot>

					<plot>Nemesis 3 (Gradius 3 in Japan) is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up. Shooting at certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind, which can be collected to add more power to the player-controlled space ship (for example special weapons or a force field). Every level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop the protagonist, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating. The plot of the game focuses on the planet Gradius, which is involved in three space wars: versus Bacterion, Venom and Salamander.</plot>

					<plot>Nemesis 3 (Gradius 3 in Japan) is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up. Shooting at certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind, which can be collected to add more power to the player-controlled space ship (for example special weapons or a force field). Every level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop the protagonist, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating. The plot of the game focuses on the planet Gradius, which is involved in three space wars: versus Bacterion, Venom and Salamander.</plot>

					<plot>In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot;. This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.The items in this game are:Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.</plot>

					<plot>Ninja Princess is an action shooter. You play as a female ninja as you fight your way through hordes of enemies on your quest to recapture territories and to take back the Castle all of which have been captured and occupied by the enemy forces. Throwing knives and shuriken are your weapons as you shoot your way through enemy occupied territory. Coming into contact with any enemies or any of their thrown projectile weapons equals instant death.

					<plot>In Norseman the player controls a Viking warrior trying to defend the magic Golden Viking Helmet.The screen shows a courtyard divided in hexagons. The player has to protect the Golden Viking Helmet, which is at the bottom of the screen, from the attack of five different kinds of enemies. Each wave of enemies is composed of 5 of them. The enemies will appear in the top of the screen and will move toward the bottom of the screen; they can only move down (or diagonally down), and once they reach the bottom or the side of the screen they will reappear on the top or the opposite side. The Viking can move in all six directions, and will also reappear on the opposite side whenever he reaches the border. In order to attack, the Viking has to move inside the hexagon the enemy is in before the enemy moves against him first. As the enemies can only move downwards, approaching them from the 3 upper sides is advised.When an enemy dies, the corpse remains in the hexagon, making it impossible to move through it. Well placed corpses can function as a trap for other enemies, as they can only move downwards. The player can also get trapped by surrounding corpses. Once all 5 enemies are dead, a new wave of enemies comes. Each new wave has different enemies, in the following order: giants, octopuses, dragons, skeletons and bats. Once all waves are beaten, the game restarts from the first wave in a greater difficulty, while retaining the player's score. If the player dies or the Golden Viking Helmet is stolen, the game is over.The game has 10 variations:Game 0: 1 helmet, monsters moving from top to bottom only.Game 1: 2 helmets, monsters moving from top to bottom only. Game 2: 3 helmets, monsters moving from top to bottom only.Game 3: Same as game 0, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.Game 4: As game 1, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.Game 5: As game 2, but this time the Viking warrior can only attack a monster when it appears in flashing, bright red.Game 6: 1 helmet, monsters will come from all directions: two monsters moving from top to bottom, and one each from left to right, from right to left and from the bottom to the top. Monsters can stumble onto one single dead colleague and thus commit suicide.Game 7: Same as game 6, but with 2 helmets.Game 8: As game 6, but with 3 helmets.Game 9: This variety combines all handicaps of the previous nine varieties: 3 helmets, monsters coming from all directs and the flashing red monsters.</plot>

					<plot>Pachicom is a pachinko game simulation. Pachinko can be described as a game that is a cross between pinball and a slot machine. This game comes with two different game modes to play. Game A lets the player play until they attain a score of at least 3000. The goal is to achieve this score as fast they possibly can. Though, the game can still end prematurely by running out of balls to shoot. Game B lets the player try to get as high of a score as possible, but with an added time limit. The game contains over 200 different board layouts to choose from. At the main menu, just choosing Game A or B will randomly assign a board for the player to play on, while choosing Select A or B will let the player select their own board of choice to play on.The gameplay is mainly passive. Players can only adjust the shooting pressure knob which effects the speed and location of where the balls will land.</plot>

					<plot>Pachinko UFO is a simulator of the popular Japanese gambling pastime of pachinko with added computerised action elements. The main screen resembles a typical pachinko unit with pins for balls to bounce on, spinners for balls to put in motion, and baskets for them to land in. The baskets open and close, and so does the big feature in the middle of the screen, an airplane or spaceship with an integrated fruit-machine like counter. When a score specified by the counters is reached, the game changes to a shooter sequence, where the pachinko balls must be used to shoot down aliens. After that, the game continues to the next table.The control mechanism is similar to golf games, in that the longer you press the button, the more power is given to the ball ejection mechanism. This makes for an experience unlike a real pachinko machine, where the perfect power of the ejector is reached by setting a dial at the right angle, after which it can be locked at that angle. In Pachinko UFO, you must hit a perfect timing instead.</plot>

					<plot>Panel Panic is a clone of Konami's old Amidar. You are a small jellyfish-like thing on a grid. You can only move on the lines of the grid, and as you move, you leave a coloured line behind. When you manage to colour all sides of a cell, it is lit up. When the entire grid is coloured, and therefore all cells are lit up, you have finished the level. Of course, there are nasties following you around, so you have to navigate smartly if you don't want to be caught.As the game progresses, the speed and number of the baddies is increased, but so is your speed. There are also bonus levels, where you gain extra lives by catching a baddie within a time limit.</plot>

					<plot>Pastfinder is a vertically scrolling action game which takes place in the year 8878. You are a member of an elite team of explorers known as the Pastfinders. Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. At the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.Finally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.The game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points. </plot>

					<plot>Jean has been separated from his girlfriend due to the world war going on, and now he must find her again, aided by the friendly blob Picot. The game is a flick-screen platform game where the protagonist is powerless, but can command Picot to help him. Picot is very versatile; you may walk behind her so that she destroys incoming enemies, you may ride on her and you may give her a push so that she bounces around the screen like a deadly ball. However, Picot is much slower than Jean, and cannot climb stairs. If Jean calls out for Picot, though, she will reach him even if it means clawing her way up against the backdrop. If Jean stands on top of Picot and call for her, she will climb higher and higher, so that out-of-reach places on the screen may be reached.</plot>

The screen is divided into five vertical paths by rows of flowers (or other shrubbery and obstacles in later stages). Within the path the protagonist can move freely up and down, but to change the path he needs to jump left or right if there is an opening. You can collect coins and various power-ups as you go. At the end of a stage you can choose one of the branching paths to advance to a different stage. </plot>

					<plot>Pitfall! is a platform action game. You play Pitfall Harry who is on a quest to locate treasure deep in the jungle. With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!</plot>

Poisonous frogs, eels, scorpions, bats and other hazards get in the way.Pitfall II is the sequel to Pitfall!, the original platform game. Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint.</plot>

					<plot>In Pooyan, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</plot>

					<studio>Kogado</studio>
					<plot>The year is 3530 AD. The KGD (an obvious nod to the developer  Kogado) Star System has fallen into the clutches of the evil Quila Empire. The hero of the game is a soldier of the Galactic Alliance who receives a mission to infiltrate a Quila base with his companion, a beautiful female android, and eventually defeat the enemy. Cosmic Soldier is an early Japan-made RPG, which still mostly follows the  Wizardry template, being a dungeon crawler with first-person navigation. Random enemy encounters lead to simple turn-based battles, graphically displayed at the top of the screen. The player cannot assign individual commands to the party members, but is able to choose various types of elemental attacks, which have different effects on different enemies.An original gameplay element is the ability to have short conversation with some enemies. It is possible to convince the enemy to join the party; this feature predates the famous demon conversations from  Megaten games. </plot>

It is an adaptation of &amp;quot;Punch &amp;amp; Judy&amp;quot;: you are the hunchback Bobby, your goal is to make your way across sixteen theater stages to rescue the beautiful Judy from the Punch. Each stage is filled with the typical hazards of a traditional play, like crocodiles, custard pies and rotten tomatoes, as well as the pits that must be crossed via moving platforms. You'll sometimes have the chance to catch a sausage flying around in the air as you move along.Even though it is a rather early game, the Spectrum version features some interesting speech samples using a technique that was very uncommon at that time.</plot>

					<studio>Zemina</studio>
					<plot>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to manoeuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with two others, and immediately removing all three. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example).The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of two sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are two sets on level 2, three on level 3, four on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your three lives.</plot>

					<plot>Grid Wars is best described as a cross between classic Jeff Minter games such as Gridrunner and Pac-Man. The playfield looks and sounds just like Gridrunner or Matrix. In the middle of the grid is your space ship, and on all four sides of the grid are moving cannons which will try to shoot you down. Your task is to avoid the fire coming from all directions, while picking up the &amp;quot;energon cubes&amp;quot; that will let your ship fly to the next level. With so much happening on screen and the clean graphics, this looks like something Mr. Minter forgot in his desk drawer some day back in 1984.Grid Wars was made for the 2006 edition of the MSXdev coding contest.</plot>

					<plot>Despite it's name, this Q*Bert installment is not a port of the first game, rather it's based on Q*Bert's Qubes. The player doesn't even control Q*Bert, but rather the dragon Wrappy. The gameplay is still focused on forming lines of blocks that match a target color, while enemies constantly enter the playfield. However there are now many different layouts in 50 different stages. Also added are differently colored blobs that function as power-ups when touched. Blue ones for example grant invincibility.Another addition are two-player simultaneous modes, where both players compete against each other, with or without enemies.The first player to complete a line of five of his target alignment wins. If the time runs out, the relevant blocks are counted, a draw leads to a round of rock-paper-scissors with a random result. </plot>

					<plot>The Ultra are an evil race of mutant aliens and in this game they invite the player to a challenge in outer space. The game is a fixed-screen shoot 'em up that consists of 16 levels. Each level has its own type of enemies with its own movement pattern. Like in other shooters the player's controls are limited to moving left and right along the bottom of the screen and blasting away at the aliens above. Too much shooting leads the weapon to overheat and the player has to wait for it to cool down. The objective is simple: to clear the whole screen and then advance to the next level. For each of the first eight levels the points increase starting with ten in the first and twenty in the second. At 2,000 and 10,000 points bonus lives are awarded. When starting out the player has five lives.</plot>

					<plot>In the Nara period in Japan (720-752 AD), there lived a sculptor named Gaou, descended from the mad scientist Dr. Saruta. At a young age, he lost an arm and eye, and was soon ridiculed by his peers for it. Eventually, it proved to be too much, and Gaou became a thief. In spite of his corrupt lifestyle, however, he was able to settle down with a wife - for a while, at least. It all came crashing to a halt over one little disagreement, as Gaou cussed her out... and then killed her!Filled with remorse, Gaou chose to repent his wicked deeds, and turned to a Buddhist monk for help. The monk's teachings eventually led him to pursue his passion for sculpting, which led to a series of powerful works renowned for the raw emotions pent up inside him that were expressed therein. But it wasn't enough - Gaou needed to be completely reborn! Hearing about the mystical phoenix, who grants those who drink its blood eternal life, from a fellow sculptor named Akanemaru, Gaou set out on a journey to find the great bird of fire... and hopefully to be reincarnated...Based on the &amp;quot;H-&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;Karma&amp;quot; volume) of Osamu Tezuka's famous manga Hinotori (or &amp;quot;Phoenix&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;Hinotori&amp;quot; is a vertically-scrolling shooting game where Gaou's goal is to locate the mystical phoenix across 6 stages of labyrinths, enemies and various other obstacles. As the game progresses, Gaou can power up by obtaining phoenix plumes to activate special weapons and other items to help him gain abilities such as invulnerability and special shots. In order to reach the final boss and pay a visit to the phoenix, Gaou must obtain a series of keys scattered across the stages - and must even backtrack to find others. The game is over when all three lives are gone - or when Gaou has reached the phoenix's lair.</plot>

					<plot>It is the 22nd century. Earth is invaded by a aliens, led by a gigantic robotic snake. To repel the attack, Earth's scientists construct the Replicart machine, a deadly robot snake. The player takes the role of the pilot of the Replicart.Replicart is a single-player only Snake game variant. In each of the 300 stages you have to collect a certain amount of a substance called 'Biteslime'. Once you fulfill your quota you can enter the next stage through an exit that opens on the left side of the screen. Collecting biteslime increases the length of your snake. If the head of your snake hits a wall, an enemy or part of its body you lose a life.  Replicart enhances the basic Snake game formula by adding power ups like a Time Stop, which freezes enemies, speed increase/decrease or level warps.The Famicom Disk System version has undergone a few changes. There are only 100 stages and after each 10 stages you have to face a boss, which must be shot down before continuing to the next set of stages.</plot>

					<plot>Rise Out From Dungeons is a platform game where you must guide an unnamed character through 20 dungeons avoiding traps and red-colored men. The graphics and game mechanics are strikingly similar to Lode Runner, but with a twist.As in Lode Runner, you must collect several objects all over the level while avoiding red-colored men, there are many stairs and gaps where you fall down if you are not careful. If you fall in the water, you die. You can also destroy blocks by shooting them with your gun. Curiously enough, the &amp;quot;red men&amp;quot; can't be defeated by your gun, and they will follow you everywhere you go, only to respawn if they reach a point where there's no way out. There are some elements which look like ropes but they are in fact just a special kind of platform: you can always walk across them safely, but if you land on them after falling down, you will just fall through them, so they actually work as traps. Other game elements include a hidden key used to open a door which leads to the stair leading out from the dungeon.The objective in each dungeon is simply to &amp;quot;rise out&amp;quot; from them, and that can be done by climbing a stair which passes through the dungeon ceiling.</plot>

					<plot>River Raid is a vertically scrolling action game. You fly a jet up a river in an attempt to destroy bridges which are vital to the enemy. The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life. </plot>

					<plot>Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, Patrolman Alex Murphy was killed on the streets of Detroit. The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...Ocean's version of RoboCop for 8-bit machines loosely adapts the Data East arcade game, with stages inspired by those from the coin-op, but also entirely new gameplay elements.In most levels, RoboCop walks from left to right, shooting his gun at hordes of enemies that intend to kill him with bullets, chainsaws or their fists. Stages include the streets of Detroit (in two parts, based on the first level of the arcade), a drug factory (based on the fourth arcade level), and a junkyard (based on the third coin-op stage). Gun power-ups to collect include a rapid fire model, a three-way shot and a powerful flame cannon. Two levels end with boss fights against RoboCop's chief adversary ED-209. For some reason, ED is impervious to bullets and must be defeated using Robo's fists alone.New challenges from the arcade include hostage scenarios: in these, seen from a first-person perspective, a criminal holds an innocent person. Moving crosshairs and firing precisely, RoboCop must take care to shoot only the criminal, not the civilian.Another new game element requires some quick thinking: in a puzzle mode, a composite sketch of a suspect is presented and must be matched by choosing the correct parts (hair, chin, eyes, etc.) of the face within a tight time limit.</plot>

					<plot>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called &amp;quot;The Force&amp;quot;, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</plot>

					<plot>The goal of Palamedes is to clear the screen which is, line by line, filling up with dice. Players control a small person situated near the bottom of the screen, who can only be moved to the left or right. The number of the dice the person is holding can be changed with the B button, pressing the A button will shoot the dice upwards. If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once.There are three modes of play: The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</plot>

					<plot>During World War II a highly guarded compound has been photographed by a reconnaissance plane hidden in a forest. After many intelligent reports it has been discovered that under the compound is a research complex which is getting nearer to the development of a bacterial virus and a new type of rocket which when combined will cause devastation and disease. You and a team of four, have been tasked to parachute into the forest in the surrounding area of the compound to find it's location, then get in the compound before trying to enter the complex. Once in the compound you have to get the plans for the virus, rocket fuel and guidance system before finally blowing the place up. Once your mission has been completed you must then get to a rendezvous point to be picked up by a plane. Remember  though, the surrounding areas have patrolling guards and the compound and complex are heavily guarded.Before you start you can pick from seven missions where each one is more difficult than the last one. The first mission is just to find the compound and photograph it while the last mission is where you have to actually blow up the complex and reach the rendezvous point. You then choose how long in hours (1-9 times ten) the mission will take before the plane arrives. Each movement in the forest is worth 20 minutes while inside the compound it is 2 minutes. Once you are happy with your selected options you must pick a team of four soldiers to attempt the mission with yourself. There are 30 skills to choose from in which you as the leader have all 30 but the other soldiers only have two of them. You are only aware of one skill for each soldier so you can interview each man to find the other skill or just select them. Each interview will take a day but you only have eight days before the mission starts. Once you are happy with your selections you then start the game. You view the forest from above with the whole forest shown on the screen. You cannot see any terrain but just the trees. You are shown as a flashing square and you can see any objects one place around you in the North, South, East and West positions. There are location's that can be found as you explore the area and they are caves, potholes, lakes or houses. These can be explored for any equipment that might be left there and next to the map of the forest is a map of the location you want to explore. You can only see so far in front so you have to move around to see more of the location's passages. Any items found can be picked up. Occasionally in the forest you will come across a patrol and these will need killing. To the right of the forest map again is a map of the area you are in showing your men's positions and the positions of the patrol. You then select which enemy soldier any of your soldiers will shoot at then move your soldier selected two places. You fire at the patrol and then they fire back. You then choose which soldier shoots who again and move them until all the patrol are dead or you have all been killed.Once you have found the complex, the screen shows an aerial view of the whole complex. Here you then attempt to complete what mission you picked at the start. It is now up to you how you want to enter the compound and move about remembering the guard patrols inside cannot be seen. If you manage to get into the complex without being discovered you move around the complex to complete the missions. Once you have fulfilled your objectives you must get out of the complex, then the compound and finally find the rendezvous point to go home. If you are captured you will be interrogated and shot.</plot>

					<plot>Shanghai is one of the first video game adaptations of the tile-based game played with the Chinese mahjong stones - essentially a puzzle game that has little to do with real mahjong rules.The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</plot>

					<plot>This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.</plot>

					<plot>In the year 189 of the stellar calendar, humanity happened upon the ruins of an ancient (and, if the st. 7 decor is anything to go by, rather decadent and malicious) civilization, and sent an archaeological crew to explore them. However, the crew managed to activate the ruins' defense system.

The system operated by identifying the Sol system as the intruders' origin, then launched the Sun-Fish (&quot;Manbou&quot; being Japanese for &quot;Sunfish&quot;), an ultimate weapon bio-mechanical starship capable of destroying an entire solar system and protected by an impregnable force-field bubble. The surviving members of the crew, however, find a chance to stop the Sun-Fish. By using an unearthed Manbou-J (i.e. Junior Sun-Fish) fighter and activating a teleportation system in the deepest part of the ruins, one pilot, Cleaver Mule, can actually get inside the force bubble and destroy the Sun-Fish from there.</plot>

He must kill the sharks in the water by throwing harpoons at them. He can swim to the banks or to ice floes above and below the island. The sharks can eat the ice floes so it isn't safe for the Eskimo to stand on them for much time, or else he'll be eaten too.The fish are held by six rows of nets. The sharks will eat those nets to get the fish, and if an entire row is destroyed, more sharks will come from the sea. The Eskimo can repair the nets by swimming to the place where they were destroyed. The more nets destroyed, the less fish is kept. A stage will end when all sharks are killed. At the end of each stage the remaining fish will be counted and added to the player's score. As the game progresses, sharks become more abundant and destroy the nets faster. The game ends when the Eskimo gets eaten by a shark.</plot>

					<plot>In Shark Hunter the player controls an Eskimo protecting fish stocks from the attack of sharks.The Eskimo starts standing on a small island in the middle of the river. He must kill the sharks in the water by throwing harpoons at them. He can swim to the banks or to ice floes above and below the island. The sharks can eat the ice floes so it isn't safe for the Eskimo to stand on them for much time, or else he'll be eaten too.The fish are held by six rows of nets. The sharks will eat those nets to get the fish, and if an entire row is destroyed, more sharks will come from the sea. The Eskimo can repair the nets by swimming to the place where they were destroyed. The more nets destroyed, the less fish is kept. A stage will end when all sharks are killed. At the end of each stage the remaining fish will be counted and added to the player's score. As the game progresses, sharks become more abundant and destroy the nets faster. The game ends when the Eskimo gets eaten by a shark.</plot>

Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears.  If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over.  Difficulty increases by dropping the pieces faster and faster over time.</plot>

He only has eyes for her and before he realizes it he finds himself in the New York sewer system.Three Russian submarines have been located in the New York sewer system and they have blocked off the system.Sam's only way out of the sewer system is to destroy the Russian submarines. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.Sam can't go back... once he's gone through the City Sewer Department seals the tunnel. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.The sewer system has three types of sewer tunnels. Tunnels with solid dry floors, tunnels with a water passage in the middle and tunnels with pits. Sam can walk, run and creep through the tunnels but Sam can't move as quickly in water.Sam can move from tunnel to tunnel by entering one of the passages that appear occasionally on his way.Each time he enters a new sewer, Sam receives a fresh supply of oxygen.On it's way through the sewer system Sam is under attack by nasties like rats, bats, spiders and more.The ultimate nasties are the Russian submarines. They are located only in water canals. The status bar at the top of the screen contains a distance indicator. It tells you how far Sam has traveled into the sewer. If it's red, it means there's a dreaded submarine at the end of the sewer.The more nasty elements you shoot, the higher you'll score.</plot>

					<plot>In the year 189 of the stellar calendar, humanity happened upon the ruins of an ancient (and, if the st. 7 decor is anything to go by, rather decadent and malicious) civilization, and sent an archaeological crew to explore them. However, the crew managed to activate the ruins' defense system.

The system operated by identifying the Sol system as the intruders' origin, then launched the Sun-Fish (&quot;Manbou&quot; being Japanese for &quot;Sunfish&quot;), an ultimate weapon bio-mechanical starship capable of destroying an entire solar system and protected by an impregnable force-field bubble. The surviving members of the crew, however, find a chance to stop the Sun-Fish. By using an unearthed Manbou-J (i.e. Junior Sun-Fish) fighter and activating a teleportation system in the deepest part of the ruins, one pilot, Cleaver Mule, can actually get inside the force bubble and destroy the Sun-Fish from there.</plot>

					<plot>Knightmare 2:Maze of Galious/Majou Densetsu 2:Daimashikyou Galious is a 
Japanese game which was released back in 1987 for MSX. It is a sequel to Knightmare. I've never played Knightmare 1 before. All I know is that it is a shooter type of game in which you play as 
Popolon who tried to rescue his wife Aphrodite from a villain named Hudnos. The
sequel takes place right after you rescued Aphrodite.  Now you play as both 
Popolon and Aphrodite, who will try to to rescue their future baby kidnapped 
by a dark priest named Galious. The gameplay is a mix between action and RPG.
You have the side-scrolling actions throughout six worlds and yet at the same
time there are some RPG elements included such as having to find certain items
to complete certain tasks. Maze of Galious stays true to its name with its huge
and sometimes confusing maze-like worlds to be explored.Majou Densetsu II: Daimashikyou Galious is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1987.</plot>

This involves collecting various items (the exact combination is different every time you load the game) and taking them to the planet's core.The game is an arcade adventure viewed from the side, with 512 screens arranged in a 16x32 pattern. A teleport system exists, so once you find the codes you can get quick access to different parts of the game.The creatures to avoid are intelligent, getting tougher to predict as you get closer to the centre, but you are armed with a gun and can also try to avoid them. BLOB has a set of platforms which can be used to allow limited vertical movement, but these disappear after a few seconds each use.</plot>

					<plot>A shoot 'em up game in the Laydock series that fits in perfectly between Laydock (Laydock 1) and Laydock 2. It's again a game that can be played by two players though a single player game is also a possibility. If played by two players they can cooperate by docking the jets together, docked side-by-side or end-to-end for greater fire and fighting power. When docked one player is the pilot and the other is the weapons officer.</plot>

					<plot>This story begins long ago. At that time, the evil Emperor Penguin happened to meet one of his subjects, Lucytesse, of matchless beauty, and he fell madly in love with her.

His love was unrequited, though. She only had eyes for her beloved Pentaro, a young good-looking penguin from the neighborhood. They were a happy couple but the Emperor, in a fit of rage and jealousy, kidnapped Lucytesse, and carried her off to his palace at the South Pole.

Pentaro departed swiftly to rescue her and, after countless perils and adventures in the ice and crevices of the South Pole, finally succeeded in reaching the Emperor's palace and rescuing his sweetheart.

They lived happily together for a while, far from the realms of the Emperor. But he had not had his final say. His revenge would consist of keeping the merry couple apart, kidnapping Pentaro this time and secluding him in a far-off place of his kingdom, far from the South Pole, lost in the boundaries of his realms and utterly unknown to our penguin. He was hoping that Pentaro's own desperation, far from his beloved and unable to escape, would become a punishment worse than death.

His cruelty knew no bounds. But Pentaro refused to resign himself to the fate the Emperor had planned for him. After overcoming numerous hazards amid the lava caverns, underground passageways and rivers, he managed to escape; not even the raging opposition from the island inhabitants who, fearful of the wrath of the Emperor, tried to keep Pentaro at any price, could hold him.

It did not take him long to realize that the unknown place from which he had just escaped was actually located on an island, thanks to the map he had gotten during his confinement. He himself could hardly have imagined how useful it would turn out to be one day...

Pentaro will have to escape from the island if he wants to meet up with his beloved Lucytesse ever again. To do, he is counting on your help!</plot>

The maze walls can be shot and destroyed. After all white tanks are destroyed, you proceed to the next level. Each level layout calls for different tactics, depending on the formations of the walls. Some spots on certain levels make for perfect ambush tactics, on other levels you must rally back and forth to eradicate the enemy tanks. Occasionally a red tank appears, shoot it for bonus points.</plot>

Some spots on certain levels make for perfect ambush tactics, on other levels you must rally back and forth to eradicate the enemy tanks. Occasionally a red tank appears, shoot it for bonus points.</plot>

					<plot>Traffic is a simple game where the player has to guide cars, motorbikes and buses through busy London streets by changing the traffic lights from red to green. The objective in order to advance to the next level is to get a preset number of vehicles through the screen, although it does not matter which exit you direct them through. Cars continue to queue off the edges of the screen (with numbers next to them if there are queued cars beyond your vision) and if the queue reach more than five cars, it's game over. A warning sound is given when five cars are queued; you must hope there are not also queues on surrounding roads. Cars always stay on their side of the road, and collisions are not possible.</plot>

					<plot>In this unofficial adaptation of the film &amp;quot;The Jewel of the Nile&amp;quot;, three travelers have been captured by a dictatorial regime in an Arab country. They must escape the country at once, and the player is the only one who can help them.In the initial screens all three tourists need to be reunited from their different prison cells. Each character also needs to find their weapon of choice, those being grenades, a pistol and an umbrella. Control between any of the travelers can be switched at any moment by typing 1, 2 or 3.Once the three travelers are reunited, every screen acts as a puzzle of sorts: the player is given a few seconds to strategically place each character before enemies appear. When they do, two of the characters will react automatically to the enemies, and the player will directly control the last character. If all enemies in the screen are eliminated and the three characters survive, they will advance to the next screen.</plot>

At the start of the game, all fruits are disguised as hearts. When Bunny passes over a heart, the fruit (lime on the first level, then pears, apples and so on) is revealed. Turtle roams the maze, eating all fruit in his path. On some occasions, the heart turns out to be broken. Broken hearts are deadly to Turtle, but when a snake passes a broken heart, it is turned into a carrot. When Bunny eats a carrot, she turns into an alien and can destroy the snakes. If a broken heart is left alone, it turns into a fearsome mosquito which hunts down Bunny.The maze is filled with bridges and tunnels so that Bunny can escape the snakes. One of Bunny's abilities is to dig holes in the ground, to reappear in one of the tunnels. After a while, the holes fill with water, where the snakes may be trapped. The thirsty Turtle, on the other hand, just drinks up the water.Turtle is usually a free-roaming creature, but by holding down the fire button, Bunny can send commands to Turtle in order to guide him to the fruits. For each fruit that he eats, the name of the fruit is spelt out. When it is fully spelt, a door in the top of the maze opens. When Turtle passes through the door, you proceed to the next level.</plot>

					<plot>In this game the player assumes the role of a space pilot named Darrian. One day, he receives a report from a nebula space station, from which he learns that nearby human colonies have been attacked by mysterious aliens known as Xenites. Darrian wastes no time, and sets off to protect the humans and stop the aliens.Xenon is an overhead shooter, in which the player controls a vehicle that is able to transform into a tank or a plane. The transformation can be usually performed by player at any time, to combat particular enemies; however, during some sequences the player is forced to use a specific type of vehicle. During the tank gameplay, the player controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the tank in the direction of choice. The game features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where the tank can't shoot them). To combat these, the player needs to transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units. Upgrades can be taken from destroyed enemies.</plot>

First of all you'll be flying over a city in your helicopter, shooting out tanks by ducking low enough to target them, but also climbing to avoid the skyscrapers in the area. The third section is viewed similarly, but sees you attempting to wipe out the planes mounted on an aircraft carrier.The second section is viewed behind your helicopter in full 3D, and adds helicopters and planes to be shot, with dodging their bullets as you duck down to shoot the tanks being the main challenge.</plot>

					<plot>Time Pilot is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need to destroy the squadrons of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points.</plot>

Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there's a kickin' party at the end if you succeed.</plot>

					<plot>Jim Hawkins is a young boy working on &amp;quot;Admiral Benbow&amp;quot;, his parent's inn. One day a sea captain named Billy Bones takes a room at the inn and stays for several months. A blind man called Pew arrives and shows something to Billy that gives him a heart attack. Jim witnesses everything and runs to aid the captain, who tells him about his sea chest and his relationship with Captain Flint, a famous pirate. After he dies Jim grabs the key dangling from the corpse and opens the dead captain's chest to collect the last payment. He finds a packet inside, and decides to take it to two aristocratic acquaintances of his, Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney. They discover a diary and a treasure map, and decide to travel to the island in search of the booty.Treasure Island is a text adventure, an adaptation of the classic 1883 novel of the same name by Robert Louis Stevenson. Unlike the book, the game is written in a second-person perspective. Otherwise, it follows the original plot closely: the player assumes the role of Jim Hawkins, and has to perform the same actions as the character in the novel. This leads to a more claustrophobic design, as players without knowledge of the book have to guess what to do next. To help alleviate that problem, other characters act as some sort of built-in hint system. The player can ask them about anything and they will provide clues when these are available. The parser accepts most of Infocom's standard features like pronouns and chain commands. </plot>

You must travel in your turboat along a river infested with enemy patrol boats which shoot at you. Unlike the above-mentioned games, you can turn your boat with a fair amount of precision. This is absolutely necessary in order to avoid the enemy shots which come not only from ships, but from turrets on the shore as well. You must also avoid contact with ground, such as the small islands which float in the river. Luckily, you can shoot back at the enemy, but don't forget to look where you're going!</plot>

					<plot>Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of Turmoil is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds.  The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way. When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens.  There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.</plot>

The spacecrafts can be moved in all 8 directions, with one button for regular shooting flying enemies and one button for dropping ground bombs.Power-ups in the form of bells can be collected by shooting clouds. The color of the bell will change if it is shot by the player, assuming one of the possible colors:Yellow: grants bonus points;White: upgrades player's guns to a twin cannon;Blue: increases player's speed (up to five levels);Green: creates image copies of the craft for more firepower;Red: provides a shield to sustain damage.The green and red bells cannot be combined. Alternate power ups can be collected from the ground, such as an alternate bell which upgrades the craft with a three way gun and a star which destroys all enemies on screen.One shot in the middle section of the craft will destroy it. Shots which hit one of the craft's arms will destroy only the arm. If both arms are lost, the craft won't be able to shoot bombs anymore and will have to be repaired by an ambulance.In the two-player mode, TwinBee (cyan craft) and WinBee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join &amp;quot;hand-to-hand&amp;quot; and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots.</plot>

					<plot>Vigilante is a side-scrolling beat-em-up. It features an anonymous tough hero that roams the streets to beat up The Rogues gang that kidnapped his girlfriend Maria. The game offers five distinct locations, such as city streets and a junkyard, with many different thugs with different strengths. You fight with your fists, feet and a chain, with a regular stance, crouched and jumping attacks. Each level features an end boss which requires a specific tactic in order to progress. Enemies keep spawning continuously from the left and the right side of the screen until the boss is reached, so a steady pace forward is required to reach the end of the level before time runs out. When enemies come too close they will grab the character and quick presses left and right are need to set him free, as he is then vulnerable to incoming attacks.</plot>

					<plot>Volguard is a traditional shoot-'em-up. You fly a plane over a parallax-scrolling landscape, filled with enemy installations which you must bomb. An easy task, if it weren't for the enemy attack waves. Most waves consist of planes flying in a straight line across the screen, without even shooting at you. Others bounce across the screen, and some are more dangerous, as they are flying in intricate patterns and firing multiple shot. Of course, you can fire back, but keep that at a minimum. The power bar at the bottom of the screen is depleted by your cannon, and when it has reached zero, your firing rate is very low. After a while, a route comrade will join you as a kind of power-up. When a third plane joins, you may merge your fighters into a flying robot.</plot>

					<plot>In a desperate measure to combat the overpopulation of Earth, scientists work to create an artificial planet named Altile, named after the scientist who designed it. During the construction of Altile, humanity has become united and peaceful. During this new era of prosperity, Earth decommissions the RoboWarriors, a force of heavily armed half-man half-robot war vehicles. But from another dimension, aliens calling themselves the Xantho Empire and lead by the being Xur invade planet Altile and terraform it for their own uses. The survivors of Altile send out a distress call to Earth. Receiving this message, the people of Earth quickly activate the latest and most powerful of the RoboWarriors, a model known as ZED (Z-Type Earth Defense) and send it at top speed to Altile.Controlling ZED from an overhead view, the player is able to move in any of 4 directions (up,down,left,right), drop bombs and shoot a projectile weapon. The terrain of Altile is made up of many obstacles and the bombs serve to destroy these and make passage for ZED. Destroying any enemy or obstacle may yield different power-ups which contain any of 10 different effects (including ammunition and energy refills) which may be stocked and used at any time from the menu. Or the power-ups may be instant-use refills for bombs and energy supplies.Additionally some levels contain keys, which unlock doors and Chalices which prevent the level from running on endlessly. Secret areas such as a Well of Hope and a Room of Idols may also be found. Altogether, there are eight different &amp;quot;worlds&amp;quot; for ZED to conquer, containing numerous stages and guarded by a vicious boss monster.</plot>

					<plot>Warroid is a game that pits two players (or one player and the AI) against each other in a robot versus robot fight. The objective: shoot the enemy warroid until it has no energy left. Destroying the enemy warroid will give the player one point on the six-point scale (the player starts out with three points each). When all points are lit in the player's color, the player wins the game. Controlling the warroid is easy, since it will always point its gun towards the enemy droids. Just push the space key to shoot a lot and jump away from the line of fire. There are multiple platform-like levels for the player to fight in.A menu (called up by pressing the escape key) will let the player customize the game so as to set handicap and the colours of the player's warroids.</plot>

					<plot>Wrangler is a Spanish-made side-scrolling shooter in which the player controls a jet pilot whose mission is to protect the city from unknown enemies. The enemies' goal is to destroy the energy centers of the city, and the brave pilot must stop them at all costs. The gameplay is similar to that of Falcon Patrol: player-controlled jet moves in four directions, destroying enemies with missiles, and needs to recharge fuel and ammunition at specific points, where it becomes particularly vulnerable to enemy attacks.</plot>

					<plot>The Brick is an Arkanoid clone embodied in the interior of a mechanic system. As such, you will have to help the racket (in this case, a nut), to impulse the ball in order to break as much bricks as possible, although there would be others that will be indestructible by your hit. To make your work more complex, there will be some flying enemies that will modify the trajectory of your ball and in the worst of the cases even shot at you, thus reducing your energy bar. In order to avoid being defeated by these creatures, you have one laser which just one projectile that recharges itself occasionally, so you will have to use it wisely too.</plot>

					<plot>Xanadu was the name of the summer capital of the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty in 13th century China. The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply &amp;quot;bumping&amp;quot; into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.Money can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a &amp;quot;karma&amp;quot; system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.</plot>

					<plot>Xanadu was the name of the summer capital of the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty in 13th century China. The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply &amp;quot;bumping&amp;quot; into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.Money can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a &amp;quot;karma&amp;quot; system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.</plot>

					<plot>Xanadu was the name of the summer capital of the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty in 13th century China. The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply &amp;quot;bumping&amp;quot; into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.Money can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a &amp;quot;karma&amp;quot; system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.</plot>

					<plot>Yellow Submarine is a variant of the submarine game, one of the oldest versions of which is the Atari 2600 game Air-Sea Battle(1977). The premise is that the player, as captain on a submarine, must shoot at mine-releasing surface ships and sub-hunting planes, all the while avoiding enemy submarines and their torpedoes. The key to playing the game correctly is to properly time the missiles/torpedoes, as well as taking their trajectory into account.</plot>

					<plot>On the December of 1875, a millionaire called Doyle was murdered and Cindy, his daughter, was found at the crime scene. Roger, her fianc, hires a young Sherlock Holmes to clear her name and help on the investigation.Young Sherlock: The Legacy of Doyle is a Japanese adventure based on the movie Young Sherlock Holmes (1985), although it has a completely different plot. Controlling Holmes and Watson, the player must investigate the murder of a millionaire by questioning witnesses and investigating parts of London. The screen is divided in three parts: a window at the bottom for text output, and above it an illustrative picture and a verb list. The verb commands used to interact with the game world are &amp;quot;walk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;examine&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;listen&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;show&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;take&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;inventory&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;use&amp;quot;.When the player walks from one place to the other, the picture portion transforms into an overhead map of London where a red square shows the position of Holmes and Watson. The player can move this square with the arrow keys, and position it over an interactive area to access it (the game writes a small description of the places the square touches).</plot>

Controlling Holmes and Watson, the player must investigate the murder of a millionaire by questioning witnesses and investigating parts of London. The screen is divided in three parts: a window at the bottom for text output, and above it an illustrative picture and a verb list. The verb commands used to interact with the game world are &amp;quot;walk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;examine&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;listen&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;show&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;take&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;inventory&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;use&amp;quot;.When the player walks from one place to the other, the picture portion transforms into an overhead map of London where a red square shows the position of Holmes and Watson. The player can move this square with the arrow keys, and position it over an interactive area to access it (the game writes a small description of the places the square touches).</plot>

					<plot>This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.</plot>

					<plot>While this MSX version of The Goonies borrows the basic concept from the Famicom (NES) version, it features completely different levels and enemies.Rather than play Mikey and save the remaining Goonies, you play as Sloth who must rescue all the Goonies, meaning you need to rescue seven Goonies per stage instead of just one so the stages are significantly longer and more complicated.To open doors you need to use keys instead of bombs, and you can only carry one key at a time. There's also an experience meter that increases every time you kill an enemy.</plot>

					<plot>While this MSX version of The Goonies borrows the basic concept from the Famicom (NES) version, it features completely different levels and enemies.Rather than play Mikey and save the remaining Goonies, you play as Sloth who must rescue all the Goonies, meaning you need to rescue seven Goonies per stage instead of just one so the stages are significantly longer and more complicated.To open doors you need to use keys instead of bombs, and you can only carry one key at a time. There's also an experience meter that increases every time you kill an enemy.</plot>

					<plot>In our universe matter and anti-matter co-exist with each other. However, prevalence of anti-matter may create chaos and eventually disrupt the normal flow of things. In a corner of a universe, a concentration of anti-matter led to the creation of an entire star, breeding forms of life threatening to destroy the world. Human beings, in an effort to save the universe, created the powerful Andorogynus - a life form capable of being male and female at once - and sent it on a mission to destroy the creation of anti-matter.Andorogynus (sic) is a top-down shoot-em-up. The player controls the titular hero(ine), shooting at constantly attacking enemies. Unlike in most games of the type, the screen scrolls down rather than up.

					<plot>In our universe matter and anti-matter co-exist with each other. However, prevalence of anti-matter may create chaos and eventually disrupt the normal flow of things. In a corner of a universe, a concentration of anti-matter led to the creation of an entire star, breeding forms of life threatening to destroy the world. Human beings, in an effort to save the universe, created the powerful Andorogynus - a life form capable of being male and female at once - and sent it on a mission to destroy the creation of anti-matter.Andorogynus (sic) is a top-down shoot-em-up. The player controls the titular hero(ine), shooting at constantly attacking enemies. Unlike in most games of the type, the screen scrolls down rather than up. The protagonist is equipped with a default single shot and has protective orbs revolving around that damage nearby enemies. The weapon can be enhanced (rapid fire, three-way fire, etc.) by collecting randomly descending power-ups. The player controls the male incarnation of the protagonist initially, but later switches to the female one.</plot>

					<plot>Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as &amp;quot;active rail playing&amp;quot;. Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.</plot>

The player controls a nameless adventurer who searches for the Sun Key, a mysterious ancient artifact which can unlock the secrets of the Mayan civilization.Taiy no Shinden: Asteka II is an adventure game which takes place in the ruins of the ancient city Chichen Itza on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. There is a top-down overworld on which the player can physically navigate the protagonist, entering temples and other locations. In such locations, the view switches to first-person perspective. The player interacts with the environment by selecting various verb commands (&amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Take&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Use&amp;quot;, etc.), represented by icons, from a menu, and combining them with objects on the screen. In spite of its Japanese origins, the game features inventory item usage and puzzle-solving, which are more typical of Western-style adventures.</plot>

The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</plot>

					<plot>Crimson is a medieval-themed role-playing game similar to Dragon Quest. The player controls a lone character, a young man whose father sent him on a mission to defeat the evil monster Crimson before passing away. Exploration is done in an overhead fashion, and is divided into world map and hostile areas, which are usually maze-like and contain one or more dungeons each. In towns the hero can buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as rest in inns.Enemies appear randomly, and the battles are turn-based. The player character can either attack, defend, or use an item. Combat is viewed from a first-person perspective. Unlike Dragon Quest, there are no random encounters on the world map. Exploration is non-linear, i.e. the player has access to many areas of the map from the beginning of the game.</plot>

					<plot>Super Daisenryaku is one of the many titles in SystemSoft's long-running war strategy series. The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included  terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya),  to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.</plot>

					<plot>Originating in the arcades, Dragon Buster is an action platform game composed out of several large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. The player's goal in every level is to reach the final stage where the protagonist faces the level boss. There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, the player character moves through platform stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since it is impossible to heal between the stages. The hero's life meter (called &amp;quot;vitality&amp;quot; in the game) is the first introduction of such a feature to action games.</plot>

Both games put you as a photographer trying to take photos of schoolgirls, where you must use your judgment to set exposure correctly. As the game(s) progresses, the option to use an automatic camera is removed, forcing you to correctly guess both aperture, shutter speed, film sensitivity and if flash should be used.</plot>

					<plot>Originating in the arcades, Dragon Buster is an action platform game composed out of several large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. The player's goal in every level is to reach the final stage where the protagonist faces the level boss. There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, the player character moves through platform stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since it is impossible to heal between the stages. The hero's life meter (called &amp;quot;vitality&amp;quot; in the game) is the first introduction of such a feature to action games.</plot>

					<plot>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as &amp;quot;Commander Jameson&amp;quot;, starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years). </plot>

Don't get cornered and if you get hit then get up your defenses or step back. The matches can be played at four different levels of difficulty. In the game there is a referee, who counts when your opponent or you are down. The matches can be set at four difficulty levels.</plot>

					<plot>Arkanoid-style Breakout clone, which unlike most other similar games has the bat on the side of the screen (there is a left/right option) instead of at the bottom.There are a number of types of special bricks, but unlike e.g. Arkanoid, they do not fall towards the bat. Instead, when you hit a special brick, it flips to show a letter. E.g. E (Extend bat), C (Catch ball), M (Missile), B (Bomb, explodes when hit by ball, clearing a number of bricks) and X (Extra life).The enemies/obstacles are more varied than in Arkanoid. Some make the bat freeze, some actually chew and eat your ball and spit out the core back at you!</plot>

					<plot>Arkanoid-style Breakout clone, which unlike most other similar games has the bat on the side of the screen (there is a left/right option) instead of at the bottom.There are a number of types of special bricks, but unlike e.g. Arkanoid, they do not fall towards the bat. Instead, when you hit a special brick, it flips to show a letter. E.g. E (Extend bat), C (Catch ball), M (Missile), B (Bomb, explodes when hit by ball, clearing a number of bricks) and X (Extra life).The enemies/obstacles are more varied than in Arkanoid. Some make the bat freeze, some actually chew and eat your ball and spit out the core back at you!</plot>

					<plot>Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...</plot>

					<plot>Ishin no Arashi is set during Bakumatsu period (around 1850 until the Meiji Restoration of 1867), the final stretch of the Japanese Edo period, which was a turbulent time, a time of great struggle between the supporters of the feudal shoguns, the rulers of the country, and the adherents of the Emperor, which eventually won and carried through the Meiji Restoration, turning Japan into a modern, powerful state. In Ishin no Arashi the player can choose one of the three major battles of Bakumastu period, and decide which leader will eventually propel Japan towards the Meiji era.This strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known  Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other  historical simulation games by  the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.</plot>

					<plot>Based on the British TV series of the same name, you play dodgy businessman Arthur Daley and your aim is to amass as much money as possible in two weeks by buying and selling merchandise of dubious provenance. Assisting you is your bodyguard/minder Terry McCann, while the policeman Sgt. Chisholm is ready to fine you if he catches you with stolen goods.You start the game with two thousand pounds and some inventory in your storage locker. Some of the goods may have already been promised to someone, and just need to be delivered. Other goods are expected, but have yet to be collected from the supplier. Goods can be bought and sold by visiting individual sellers, or the Winchester pub where a variety of wheeler-dealer types hang out. Each character present at the time is represented graphically in the top half of the screen and is associated with a number. By pressing that number (quickly, as there is a time limit) you can initiate conversation with that character. If you fail to select a character before the time limit, a random character may start speaking with you. All dialogue involves buying items from them (using text commands like &amp;quot;I WANT&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;HOW MUCH&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;OFFER&amp;quot;) or selling items to them.Once a deal has been agreed, the goods need to be moved. Your minder, Terry McCann can assist with this, and can be found at the Winchester, or in his flat (although he will tend to be uncooperative after working hours). He can be asked to collect or deliver items. If you are meeting with a dealer who might be upset with you because you have sold them poor quality merchandise, you can ask Terry to &amp;quot;MINDER&amp;quot; and he will accompany you to prevent violence (to you). Terry can also &amp;quot;DUMP&amp;quot; goods if they are stolen and you have the law breathing down your neck, so need to just get rid of them. You can tell goods are stolen because you will be questioned about them at odd times by Sgt. Chisholm. If he catches you with the goods at the storage locker, you will need to pay a hefty fine.</plot>

					<plot>The game is based on the manga Maison Ikkoku by Rumiko Takahashi.Set in Tokyo of the 80-ies, the story can be described as a romantic tale with a touch of comedy. It centers on a boarding house which is managed by the young and lovely widow Kyoko Otonashi. The protagonist is a college student named Yusaki Godai, and his relationship with Kyoko is the main plot line. The game's story approximately corresponds to the middle volumes of the manga until the conclusion.The game is a &amp;quot;puzzle-less&amp;quot; adventure, the gameplay mostly focusing on simply depleting all the verb commands at every given screen and moving between locations. The commands include the usual &amp;quot;Look&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot;, and Move&amp;quot; typical for Japanese adventures (no &amp;quot;Think&amp;quot; command), but also context-sensitive commands &amp;quot;Eat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Drink&amp;quot;, etc., as well as the possibility to use certain inventory items.</plot>

					<plot>Mai is a little girl with cat ears who studies the art of magic. Unfortunately, she doesn't always do her homework, and sometimes loses control of her magical powers. This is precisely what happened one day, when she accidentally unleashed a magical spell upon terrified classmates. Now the poor girl is being hunted down by male and female students, teachers, and other people, and she has to fight for her life while perfecting her magic-casting skills.Mai is similar to the better-known Mad Monogatari games in many ways: it is a solo pseudo-3D first-person dungeon crawl; it casts a little innocent girl with magical powers as the heroine; it displays no numeric statistics (damage feedback, the heroine's progress, etc. are shown only graphically or with the help of text messages); it has an overall &amp;quot;cute&amp;quot; theme with comical animations. However, unlike Mad Monogatari, Mai contains graphical nudity and scenes with mild depiction of sexual situations.</plot>

					<plot>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler  after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.</plot>

You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.</plot>

					<plot>Predator: Soon The Hunt Will Begin is an 2D action game. There are 30 stages in the game, and each one is split up into two modes: Jungle Mode, and Big Mode. In Jungle Mode, the object of the game is to survive the dangers of the jungle while you shoot down guerillas and wildlife using  variety of weapons including machine guns, laser rays, and grenades (all with unlimited ammo). You exit the stage by entering a cave to proceed to the next level. Sometimes there is more than one cave, and you will be warped to another stage other than the next one, depending on what cave you enter.After three or so stages, you enter the game's Big Mode. The object here is to blast blue and purple spheres before they have a chance to hurt you. Some spheres have power-ups that will increase your firepower. When you have made some distance, you have to defeat the Predator before you can continue on to the next stage. Big Mode is the same throughout the game, but the only difference here is the Predator's attack pattern.</plot>

					<plot>Quinpl is a japanese puzzle game of the King's Valley II and Eggerland Mystery variety. The main objective is to reach a exit door by jumping over and destroying blocks and monsters. The player's character can shoot stakes that kill the monsters and stick to the blocks (he can jump on these stakes and eventually break those blocks, clearing the path to the exit door). If he touches any of the monsters or dangerous environments, he transforms into a blue frog and the player loses one life. There are several items that can be collected: some of them are immobile, some randomly float around the screen.On the top of the screen there are a inventory of collected items, a timer and the number of lives. Both the cartridge and disk versions allow saving the game between levels.</plot>

There are only 100 stages and after each 10 stages you have to face a boss, which must be shot down before continuing to the next set of stages.</plot>

					<plot>Shanghai II is a variant of the puzzle game also known as solitaire mahjong. 144 mahjong tiles are arranged in rows and stacked upon each other in various patterns; the player's goal is to remove pairs of matching tiles that do not have adjacent tiles from both sides until the whole board is clear. This variant features six patterns named after animals: tiger, scorpion, monkey, snake, panther, and dragon. The player can choose to display hints or reverse any amount of moves. A mode with a time limit is available as well.</plot>

					<plot>Players take control of Demon Kogure, a member of the real life Japanese heavy metal band Seikima-II. He is on a mission to rescue his fellow &amp;quot;demon&amp;quot; bandmates who have been captured and imprisoned by the God Zeus.The game is broken up into four zones that are composed of eight areas each. In each area players have to collect all the visible items laying around to complete that area. Once all the items are collected in the seven areas of a zone, players can then enter the eighth area where they will find one of their bandmates locked inside a cage. After collecting all the items in the eighth zone, the player has to open the lids of three caskets. After the last casket is opened it will produce a key, which can then be used to release the locked up bandmate. While collecting all the visible items, players will be continuously attacked by enemies that they can either try to jump and dodge or shoot their projectile weapon at them. Getting hit by an enemy will decrease the players life, which is already constantly draining.One of the items the player collects are moneybags. Collected moneybags earn the player money which can in turn be spent at the various shops found throughout the game. Shops sell life potions, stronger weapons, and also musical instruments for each band member.</plot>

					<plot>Due to mysterious circumstances, a flourishing city called Chinese Hill was cut off the rest of the world. Investigators found out that most of the buildings were destroyed, horrifying creatures are roaming the wilderness, and the few survivors have no means of escaping. The SSWAT (Supernatural Special Weapon Attack Team) sends an agent named Laila to the city. The young woman has powerful psychic abilities, which can enhance her firearms, helping her deal with the monsters. She must rescue the survivors and escort them to safety, at any cost...Shiry Sensen - War of the Dead is an action game with slight RPG elements. The player navigates Laila over the top-down &amp;quot;world map&amp;quot;: the ruined city has basically turned into large wilderness areas with a few buildings that are represented by icons on the map and can be explored. Enemies attack randomly. The battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully action-based. Laila can jump, duck, and attack with melee or weapons or firearms (which require ammunition). Typically there are several enemies on the screen; Laila escapes the battle if she reaches the end of the short side-scrolling area. The goal of the game is to find and rescue the few survivors trapped in the buildings infested by enemies. Laila has to bring these survivors back to the church. Even though the map is almost completely open to the player (especially after Laila acquires a boat, which makes the world fully explorable), the rescuing must be completed in a linear fashion, by talking to characters in different buildings and receiving clues. The game has a day/night cycle; Laila can sleep at any time, which will restore a portion of her health. </plot>

					<plot>In the year 189 of the stellar calendar, humanity happened upon the ruins of an ancient (and, if the st. 7 decor is anything to go by, rather decadent and malicious) civilization, and sent an archaeological crew to explore them. However, the crew managed to activate the ruins' defense system.

The system operated by identifying the Sol system as the intruders' origin, then launched the Sun-Fish (&quot;Manbou&quot; being Japanese for &quot;Sunfish&quot;), an ultimate weapon bio-mechanical starship capable of destroying an entire solar system and protected by an impregnable force-field bubble. The surviving members of the crew, however, find a chance to stop the Sun-Fish. By using an unearthed Manbou-J (i.e. Junior Sun-Fish) fighter and activating a teleportation system in the deepest part of the ruins, one pilot, Cleaver Mule, can actually get inside the force bubble and destroy the Sun-Fish from there.</plot>

					<plot>Super Daisenryaku is one of the many titles in SystemSoft's long-running war strategy series. The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included  terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya),  to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.</plot>

					<plot>The witch Circe imprisoned twelve virgins for a ritual sacrifice. Ulysses, the Greek hero, recently washed away on the beach after a storm destroyed his ship and its crew, is summoned by the populace to rescue the kidnapped women. In exchange, they promise to help him return to Itaca, his home. To aid in his quest, he receives from a wise elder a magical hammer.Ulises is a side-scrolling platform game from Spain. Although Spanish, the game has almost no text. The Ulysses character moves from left to right throwing hammers to kill an incessant wave of enemies. The game doesn't have levels, but sections within one expansive level. Precise jumps are required to clear abysses and gorges, and to avoid collision with dangerous objects. Ulysses can also crouch. The game starts with three lives, and each rescued damsel adds an extra one. There isn't any form of saving progress.</plot>

These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.</plot>

					<plot>The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process.The first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with  Ultima and  Might &amp; Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre.The player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.</plot>

					<plot>This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.</plot>
