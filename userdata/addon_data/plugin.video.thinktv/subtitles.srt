00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:07,766
NARRATOR:
    Almost a century since
    the outbreak of World War I,

2
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:10,166
archaeologists in Europe
    are uncovering

3
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:14,200
a unique time capsule
    from that conflict.

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,533
(artillery fire)

00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:19,266

00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:25,566
has been in Belgium

10
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:29,800
following a massive
    archaeological dig,

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,800
and it's revealing
    how World War I

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,633
became a technological
    arms race.

13
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,733
For four years,
    70 million men fought

14
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:46,266
in the first ever
    industrialized war.

15
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:50,233
Nine million died as new
    and more powerful weapons

16
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,333
enabled both sides
    to fight each other

17
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,100
to a bloody standstill
    in trenches,

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,366
many of them stretching
    across France and Belgium.

19
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:00,266
(artillery fire)

20
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,133
(explosion)

21
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,666
It was a war
    that came to epitomize

22
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,600
man's inhumanity to man.

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,233
MAN:
    It must be a gas shell.

24
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:12,600
MAN:
    Phosgene is not an instant gas.

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,266
It can take 24 hours
    to come into effect.

26
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:16,233
A horrible, horrible,

27
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,500
and painful,
    agonizing way to die.

28
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:23,033
NARRATOR:
    The dig is on a site

29
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:25,100
where the entire history
    of that war

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,600
is uniquely captured.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,866
We discover how the conflict
    went underground

32
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:36,900
to blast the w out
    of its trench-bound deadlock.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,733
Stop, stop, stop.

34
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:39,633
Is it possible
    to turn the camera?

35
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,166
NARRATOR:
    It's here Allied troops

36
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:44,400
would secretly tunnel
    beneath enemy lines

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,400
and create the biggest explosion
    the world had ever seen.

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,200
(explosion)

39
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,766
NAATOR:
    With time and weather
    against them,

40
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:58,900
surrounded by unexploded
    ammunition,

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,666

NARRATOR:
    Messines-- today,
    a peaceful town in Flanders,

63
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:14,166
a region of Belgium
    on the border of France,

64
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,200
but almost 100 years ago,

65
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,500
the site
    of the biggest explosion

66
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,866
the world had ever seen.

67
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:24,866
(explosion)

68
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:28,900
During World War I,
    this was the Western Front,

69
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,766
where German and Allied soldiers
    faced each other

70
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:34,000
in a hellish killing field.

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,466
For over three years,
    the battle lines barely moved

72
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:42,866
as the war took lives
    by the hundreds of thousands.

73
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:45,766
(explosion)

74
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:47,733
The stalemate drove each side

75
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:51,700
to develop increasingly
    deadly weaponry,

76
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,933
triggering a high-speed,
    technological arms race

77
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:59,000
that gave birth to modern
    mechanized warfare.

78
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:05,666
Now, prompted by a project

79
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:09,666
to lay a two-kilometer pipeline
    around the town of Messines,

80
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,333
a team of archaeologists has
    been called in to clear a path

81
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,433
through the remains
    of these long buried trenches

82
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,466
where so many fought and died.

83
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:25,033
What they are discovering,
    buried in this unique site,

84
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:28,833
is a snapshot
    of the first modern arms race.

85
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,233
MAN:
    The round one here is German,

86
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:33,166
and the pointed one is British.

87
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,000
NARRATOR:
    Miraculously preserved
    for a century,

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,066
these trenches hold the entire
    technological history

89
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:45,333
of World War I,
    from horses to tanks.

90
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:52,100
Racing against
    the construction schedule,

91
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,500
they hope to preserve
    invaluable clues

92
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,700
and to discover
    which technological innovations

93
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,866
helped to finally break
    the deadlock.

94
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:13,500
Just outside Messines, work
    has begun on the new pipeline.

95
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,433
The undercarriages
    of the heavy equipment

96
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,500
are fitted with armor plating,

97
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,000
and the glass
    has been reinforced

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,900
because nearly 100 years
    after the war,

99
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,266
the ground here is still full
    of unexploded shells.

100
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:31,300
It is rich,
    if dangerous, pickings

101
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,500
for Belgian scientist
    Simon Verdegem,

102
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,033
who leads
    the archaeological dig.

103
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:42,166
Working alongside him are
    ex-Belgian military personnel

104
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,833
trained in bomb disposal.

105
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,866
But one of their first
    discoveries offers evidence

106
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:50,833
of the decidedly low-tech
    beginnings of the conflict.

107
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:56,666
SIMON VERDEGEM:
    It looks like the jaw
    of a horse.

108
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:01,133
You can see the jaw,
    the end of the jaw.

109
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,033
Here, you have the teeth.

110
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:05,033
This is the front.

111
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:09,266
There are some more teeth
    over here that came loose.

112
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:11,500
That one belongs here.

113
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,400
It's definitely from a horse.

114
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,800
NARRATOR:
    World War I began
    in August 1914,

115
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,800
when Germany invaded
    Belgium and France.

116
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,000
The Allies pushed
    the Germans back,

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,400
digging in at Messines
    and elsewhere.

118
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,533
At the beginning of the war,

119
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:42,833
the British army had
    165,000 horses on its books,

120
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,800
and in the slaughter
    that followed,

121
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,933
it was not only the soldiers
    who would die.

122
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:50,000
(flies buzzing)

123
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,033
VERDEGEM:
    You can see a row of teeth.

124
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,766
NARRATOR:
    Horses and mules were used
    extensively in the war,

125
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:02,833
from pulling artillery

126
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:07,066
to carrying water to the troops
    at the front.

127
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:10,700
They were the war horses.

128
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,533
At the start of the conflict,

129
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:17,866
mounted cavalry were expected
    to lead the fight.

130
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:21,100
It was a British cavalry unit,
    the 9th Lancers,

131
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,200
who were holding
    part of the town of Messines

132
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,000
in the autumn of 1914.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,833
The Germans who were
    approaching the town

134
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,900
were intent on removing them.

135
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,066
ALEXANDRA CHURCHILL:
    The Lancers are in trenches
    to the east of Messines,

136
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:40,133
and prior to the German attack,
    they were being heavily shelled.

137
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:42,266
(artillery fire)

138
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:43,966
(explosion)

139
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,566
It's quite a miserable position

140
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,033
for them to be in,
    because not only have they got

141
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,000
to think about themselves
    and protect themselves,

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,100
but they've got horses
    to look after as well.

143
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,933
It's effectively like dragging
    a small child

144
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,366
around the Western Front
    because you've got to constantly

145
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:01,200
give care and attention
    to the animal,

146
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,900
but at the same time,
    you're still expected

147
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,933
to do everything that
    an infantry battalion is doing.

148
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:10,766
NARRATOR:
    Among the officers of the
    9th Lancers defending the town

149
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:14,200
were two brothers
    in their early 20s:

150
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,033
Douglas and Lenny Harvey.

151
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:21,900
At dawn on the 31st of October,

152
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,066
the Germans launched their push
    for Messines.

153
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,666
(explosions)

154
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,233
CHURCHILL:
    For the 9th Lancers,
    it's just horrific.

155
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:32,299
The Germans successfully
    push the Lancers back,

156
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,166
and they're forced to retreat
    into the town itself.

157
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,533
And they're getting fired on

158
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:40,133
from in front, behind,
    to the side

159
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:43,700
from machine guns, rifles,
    and artillery shells as well,

160
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,633
so it's a pretty dire situation.

161
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:49,300
NARRATOR:
    The 9th Lancers regrouped
    at the cemetery

162
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,566
before being pushed
    from the town,

163
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,900
which then fell to the Germans.

164
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,100
(explosion)

165
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,800
The battle had claimed the lives

166
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,800
of both Douglas
    and Lenny Harvey.

167
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,033
The war was barely
    three months old.

168
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,233
Having taken Messines,

169
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:16,100
the Germans now set about
    consolidating their gains

170
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,333
by digging trenches
    to protect their troops.

171
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:24,900
The front line was etched
    into the battlefield.

172
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:30,666
Only days into the dig,

173
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:35,566
archaeologists uncover the floor
    of a World War I German trench,

174
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:41,200
part of a huge network
    which defined the war.

175
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,233
MAN:
    Both sides dug in.

176
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,466
They dug trenches
    to protect their troops.

177
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:48,433
The Germans dug in at Messines,
    and the British just below,

178
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:51,566
separated by just a short
    stretch of no-man's land

179
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:54,000
that could be just
    tens of yards apart.

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,666
And by early 1915,
    this massive network of trenches

181
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,833
now stretched
    from the North Sea coast

182
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,700
right through and down
    to the Swiss border--

183
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,666
450 miles
    of continuous trenches.

184
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,766
(explosions)

185
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:12,233
NARRATOR: Both sides tried
    with brute force

186
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:15,700
to break this deadlock
    on the Western Front.

187
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,233
When British troops went
    over the top of the trenches

188
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:19,800
at the Battle of the Somme,

189
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,500
they suffered nearly
    60,000 casualties

190
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,366
on the first day alone.

191
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:28,000
At the battle of Verdun,
    over 700,000 fell

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,233
over ten months of fighting.

193
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:35,433
But for the time being,
    nothing defeated the trenches.

194
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:43,200
(engine whirring)

195
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,033
At Messines, the team has been
    struggling on the site.

196
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:50,400
A day's worth of rain

197
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,766
has transformed the dig
    into a quagmire.

198
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:56,866
It's a scene that would be
    all too familiar

199
00:10:56,866 --> 00:11:01,300
to the soldiers
    of the First World War.

200
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,566
The archaeologists
    bail out the trenches

201
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:06,333
with their safety helmets,

202
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:11,466
as soldiers would have done
    with their steel helmets.

203
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,233
CHURCHILL:
    In the winter of 1914, '15,

204
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:15,533
if it wasn't raining,
    it was snowing,

205
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,566
so consequently,
    in the trenches,

206
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:20,466
it was muddy beyond belief.

207
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:21,700
They were sinking
    up to their knees

208
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,800
and some even deeper
    trying to get through them.

209
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
It got so bad that
    they had to abandon trenches,

210
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,566
and men were chancing

211
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:31,833
going over the top
    and risking sniper fire

212
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,733
to be able to not suffer
    the discomfort

213
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,066
of getting covered in this mud

214
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,566
and having to wade knee deep
    through it.

215
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,833
If we look at the map,

216
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,600
just ahead of us,
    probably on the rise...

217
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,033
NARRATOR:
    Helping the archaeologists
    at the Messines dig

218
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:55,066
is the discovery
    of a highly detailed German map

219
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,300
of the trench systems.

220
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:01,066
Marked on the trench map

221
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:04,533
in front of both the German
    and British positions

222
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:08,766
are belts of barbed wire.

223
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:13,800
Barbed wire was an unexpectedly
    effective and ferocious barrier,

224
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,166
feared and hated by the soldiers
    who had to get through it.

225
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,933
VERDEGEM:
    We've found this almost complete
    roll of British barbed wire.

226
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:25,066
REED:
    It's certainly fearful-looking
    barbs, but you're right,

227
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:28,100
it definitely looks like
    British wire.

228
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,966
Barbed wire was
    an American invention

229
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,866
used for agricultural purposes--

230
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:34,900
to contain cattle
    on the big, open prairies.

231
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,400
But by the American civil war,
    it had a military use.

232
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,033
It could be used to defend
    positions on the battle field.

233
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,800
And that use increased

234
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,566
throughout the course
    of the next century

235
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,466
until the time
    of the First World War,

236
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,533
when it was used
    on a massive scale,

237
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:52,200
literally thousands of miles
    of barbed wire fences.

238
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,266
A lot of people think,

239
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:55,166
when they find pieces
    of barbed wire like this,

240
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,733
"Is it modern
    agricultural wire?"

241
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,666
But as soon as you put
    your fingers on it, you can see,

242
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,866
because if it's
    a modern barbed wire fence,

243
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:02,833
we can probably get
    our whole hand in there,

244
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,500
but you can barely get
    two fingers

245
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,466
because they didn't want you
    to be able

246
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:09,033
to get some grip on it
    so you could cut it.

247
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,733
The Devil's rope,
    as it became known,

248
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:13,666
was used on an increasing scale.

249
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,466
There was some evil-looking
    barbed wire,

250
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:18,833
even razor wire
    being used by the Germans

251
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,766
in some parts of their line,

252
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,566
and troops became
    obsessed with it,

253
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:26,633
became obsessed with hanging
    on the barbed wire.

254
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:30,233
NARRATOR:
    Barbed wire would stop
    advancing troops.

255
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:33,633
There, they would face
    another American invention:

256
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:36,900
the Maxim machine gun,
    which was used by both sides.

257
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:45,100
The Maxim gun was the first
    self-powered machine gun.

258
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,933
When a bullet is fired,
    it produces a recoil.

259
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:52,733
A spring uses that energy
    to eject the spent casing

260
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,366
and to fire the next bullet.

261
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:58,700
Although the Maxim gun was heavy
    and required water-cooling,

262
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,966
it could fire
    up to 600 rounds per minute,

263
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:06,000
equivalent
    to 30 contemporary rifles.

264
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,766
Stuck on the barbed wire,
    soldiers would be slaughtered

265
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,566
by the efficient
    killing machine.

266
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:22,466
At Bayernwald,
    a German front line trench

267
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:24,500
has been restored
    in the same spot

268
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,000
where it was first dug
    on the Messines Ridge

269
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,800
in November 1914.

270
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,366
MAN:
    This is a really good example
    of the kind of thing

271
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:36,333
that they would have to build
    and live in

272
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,033
on a day-to-day basis.

273
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:40,900
NARRATOR:
    Military historian
    Professor Peter Doyle

274
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
has studied the distinctive way

275
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,166
the Germans constructed
    their trenches early in the war.

276
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,200
DOYLE:
    The trenches themselves

277
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,966
had the sides held back
    by wattle and brushwood,

278
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:55,100
and what they would have done
    is to bind this wood together

279
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,300
to hold back the mud

280
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,000
which was continually collapsing
    into these trenches.

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,900
(explosion)

282
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,133
NARRATOR:
    Mud wasn't the German's
    only problem.

283
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:07,100
The British were constantly
    shelling the trenches,

284
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,733
and the real danger
    in this early war trench design

285
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:14,500
was when a shell
    fell right inside.

286
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,166
DOYLE:
    What we can see in this trench
    are some fatal flaws.

287
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,700
The trench is quite wide,
    which is good--

288
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,866
it gives real access--
    but it's also quite long.

289
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:25,766
And if a shell exploded here,

290
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:29,800
the blast radius would kill
    most of the occupants.

291
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,900
So this is a pretty
    dangerous place to be.

292
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,500
I can't imagine that the Germans

293
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,433
would really like
    sitting in this trench,

294
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,033
waiting for this kind of thing
    to happen.

295
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:39,200
(artillery fire)

296
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,433
NARRATOR:
    Artillery was the biggest killer
    in World War I.

297
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:48,433
60% of all casualties
    were caused by shellfire.

298
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:50,966
For almost three years
    at Messines,

299
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:57,100
there were no major assaults;
    just the day-to-day bombardment

300
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,733
that slowly ground
    the soldiers down.

301
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:03,966
MAN:
    Total silence would have been
    very, very rare.

302
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:05,066
(explosion)

303
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,233
It's very difficult
    for people to imagine

304
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,133
just how assailed your senses
    would have been,

305
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,400
particularly with shellfire.

306
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,966
And a lot of nervous disorders
    suffered by Great War soldiers,

307
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:18,366
such as shell shock,
    were a consequence

308
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:20,000
not so much of mental injury,

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,800
but actually
    the way that shelling

310
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,233
affected the nervous system
    and indeed the mind.

311
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,866
NARRATOR: Something at the dig
    is becoming apparent.

312
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:36,933
Each of the circles
    being marked by spray paint

313
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:41,700
is the in-filled crater
    from an exploded British shell.

314
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,666
And the numbered markers show

315
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,466
they are getting
    closer together.

316
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:49,466
For the archaeologists,
    it's a clue they're closing in

317
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,066
on an important target
    for the British artillery.

318
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,200
The British were aiming
    for the German front line,

319
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,966
and as the team digs,
    they begin to unearth

320
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:09,366
a complete section of a First
    World War fighting trench.

321
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,400
DOYLE:
    It's just phenomenal.

322
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,633
NARRATOR:
    Professor Peter Doyle
    has come to the Messines dig

323
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:21,333
to meet Simon Verdegem and see
    the newly uncovered trench.

324
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,900
DOYLE:
    Just by excavating a trench
    as small as this,

325
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,000
we get a real sense of the true
    nature of trench warfare,

326
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,100
and it's pretty exciting
    to see that here.

327
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,633
NARRATOR:
    We know what the trench
    should look like

328
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,966
from this rare
    wartime photograph

329
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:38,500
of the trench
    that connects to it.

330
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,433
DOYLE:
    Shall we get out
    and look at the other side?

331
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:43,266
NARRATOR:
    But what the new trench reveals

332
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:45,966
is that unlike the trenches
    at Bayernwald,

333
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,733
this trench
    had been blown to pieces.

334
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:52,400
VERDEGEM:
    And the explosion actually
    pushed the side of trench

335
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,766
into the middle.

336
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:56,166
You can see some
    of the floorboards sticking out.

337
00:17:56,166 --> 00:18:00,000
NARRATOR:
    The trench at some stage
    received a direct hit

338
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,333
from a British
    high explosive shell.

339
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:06,633
(explosion)

340
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:09,000
Amazingly,
    the top of the shell

341
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,800
is still lodged
    among the collapsed timbers.

342
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,666
Isn't that fantastic
    that an impact fuse...

343
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,933
And actually
    the result of the impact,

344
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:20,233
and it's frozen in time.

345
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:23,266
VERDEGEM:
    Everything that's
    underneath those boards

346
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:24,933
hasn't moved
    since the explosion.

347
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:27,900
REED:
    I've never seen
    anything like that.

348
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:33,900
NARRATOR:
    But why was only a small section
    of the trench destroyed?

349
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,000
This wartime reconnaissance film

350
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,033
shows that the trenches
    were constructed

351
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,333
with a series
    of rectangular switchbacks,

352
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,466
like the top of a castle wall.

353
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:47,700
It was a design adopted
    by both sides

354
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,700
to protect soldiers
    in the trenches on either side

355
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,133
of a direct hit.

356
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,233
DOYLE:
    This is a much more of a secure
    way of digging a trench

357
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,933
because any kind of explosion

358
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:00,766
would be kept in one area
    of the trench.

359
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:08,233
NARRATOR:
    In the stalemate
    of trench warfare at Messines,

360
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:12,133
the killing continued.

361
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:14,066
Among the graves
    in this cemetery

362
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:17,933
below the German trenches
    is an unusual marker:

363
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:20,266
that of Robert Cuthbert,

364
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:25,300
a former accountant and member
    of the New York Yacht Club.

365
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,733
He died when he was 47,
    old for a soldier.

366
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:34,100
Cuthbert was one of at least
    five Americans buried here

367
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,900
who had joined the Allied cause

368
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:41,100
more than two years
    before America entered the war.

369
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,400
The Germans were determined
    to hold on to the trenches

370
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,000
on the high ground
    of the Messines Ridge.

371
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,600
(artillery fire)

372
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,066
But the growing intensity of the
    British artillery bombardment

373
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:58,900
was forcing them
    to build stronger defenses

374
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,900
and entrench even deeper.

375
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,900
It's a fact borne out

376
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,366
by the archaeologists'
    latest discovery:

377
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:10,500
an extraordinarily
    well-preserved trench

378
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,566
leading to a concrete
    structure-- a German bunker.

379
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:19,566
The bunker's walls are
    over 30 inches thick,

380
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,400
strong enough
    to shelter infantry

381
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,133
from all
    but the biggest shells.

382
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,433
If the Allies were
    to take the ridge,

383
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:30,400
dozens of bunkers like this
    would have to be neutralized.

384
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,633
But for Simon Verdegem
    and the team,

385
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:40,933
the most exciting discovery
    is the best-preserved

386
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:46,433
and deepest trench
    ever uncovered in Flanders.

387
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:48,566
VERDEGEM: We are standing
    in the main trench

388
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:50,733
leading towards the entrance
    of the bunker.

389
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:54,466
We are actually standing
    on the original floorboards now,

390
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,966
which are in a remarkable
    good condition.

391
00:20:56,966 --> 00:21:00,000
It's amazing, the condition
    of this trench.

392
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,500
I've never seen an original
    trench of this depth

393
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,966
ever uncovered on a battlefield,
    or ever been in one.

394
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:11,000
VERDEGEM:
    Over here, we have two things
    which are very special.

395
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,666
On our left side,

396
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,933
we have a board
    to put rifle butts in.

397
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:17,633
So this is a rifle rack?

398
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,733
Yeah, exactly.

399
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:23,533
It's a rifle rack
    which could hold six rifles,

400
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,433
which we think indicates that

401
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:28,000
this bunker had room
    for six soldiers.

402
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:34,233
REED:
    Incredible to see here

403
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:38,500
these original boards
    and the original steps

404
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,133
going down
    into this First World War

405
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,600
dug out with the floorboards
    still there.

406
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,433
Incredible.

407
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,200
NARRATOR:
    In one of the trenches,

408
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,966
the archaeologists find evidence
    that the Germans

409
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:59,200
were fully expecting to fight
    at close quarters.

410
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:08,200
VERDEGEM:
    It looks like hand grenades,

411
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,366
German hand grenades.

412
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:13,800
We have one, two, three, four,
    five, six, seven, eight, nine,

413
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,333
at least ten hand grenades.

414
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:21,333
NARRATOR:
    Because the grenades
    are still live,

415
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,033
Verdegem calls
    the Belgian bomb squad,

416
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:27,400
who will come
    and make them safe.

417
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,766
100 years on, these weapons
    are still lethal.

418
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:35,466
ALEX TURNER:
    Hand grenades were the weapon
    of choice for an infantryman

419
00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:37,033
in the First World War
    in the attack,

420
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:40,200
and here we have
    a German stick grenade,

421
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,633
known as a potato masher,
    and same nickname in German--

422
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:44,100
"Kartoffelstampfer."

423
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,366
And it has an explosive charge
    on the end of a wooden stick

424
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,333
which allows you more leverage
    in the throw

425
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,833
and allows you to lob it
    more accurately.

426
00:22:53,466 --> 00:22:57,200
NARRATOR:
    The stick grenade
    was introduced in 1915,

427
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,900
d its simple design lasted
    into World War II.

428
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,366
It works by placing a detonator
    in an explosive charge

429
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:08,766
packed within the head.

430
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:10,933
The detonator
    is attached to a cord

431
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:13,733
which runs through
    the hollow base.

432
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:17,166
Pulling the cord
    set a five-second fuse burning.

433
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:22,066
It has an idiot's guide
    on the handle

434
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,933
which tells you how long
    the fuse is going to last

435
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:26,200
once you've initiated it.

436
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,833
You unscrew the base
    and a little string emerges,

437
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,566
which when tugged
    effectively strikes a match

438
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:33,366
in the base
    of the grenade head there

439
00:23:33,366 --> 00:23:35,266
and gives you
    five-and-a-half seconds

440
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:37,500
to lean back,
    take an aimed throw,

441
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,666
and lob it
    in the direction of attack.

442
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:45,400
(explosion)

443
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,766
NARRATOR:
    But there was one weapon used
    at Messines

444
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:50,133
that more than any other
    would come to symbolize

445
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:53,933
the real horror
    of the First World War.

446
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:58,300
VERDEGEM:
    It might be a gas shell.

447
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:03,366
NARRATOR:
    In June 1916,
    the Germans released phosgene,

448
00:24:03,366 --> 00:24:06,100
a type of poisonous
    chlorine gas,

449
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,300
from canisters sited here
    above the dig.

450
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,666
Heavier than air, it flowed down
    the 500 yards of no-man's land

451
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,733
towards the British trenches

452
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:22,066
at the bottom
    of the Messines Ridge.

453
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:25,100
Just after midnight,
    British sentries observed

454
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,700
the gas clouds
    in the bright moonlight.

455
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:34,600
(rattling)

456
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,100
The noise of the gas rattle

457
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,566
alerted the British troops
    that an attack was imminent.

458
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,033
They would have had just minutes

459
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:44,833
to put on their protective
    gas hoods

460
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:48,566
equipment which would bring
    its own set of problems.

461
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:50,000
MAN:
    It's absolutely terrible.

462
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,300
You can't see--
    it mists up almost instantly.

463
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,833
The eye pieces go everywhere,

464
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:58,533
and as soon as you breathe
    the wrong way, it steams up.

465
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:00,433
It's already hot in here now.

466
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:01,666
You've lost
    all your side vision.

467
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,200
You can't see any more than
    what's right in front of you.

468
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
You'd be turning to your right,
    turning to your left

469
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,966
to try to see
    where the enemy is coming from.

470
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:16,333
NARRATOR:
    The release of gas usually
    preceded a German attack.

471
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,433
So that night, British artillery
    laid down a barrage

472
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:21,633
in order to prevent
    any German troops

473
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:24,533
from reaching their lines.

474
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,366
(artillery fire)

475
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,933
David Whithorn is
    a military historian.

476
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:35,200
What he has just done--
    removed his gas hood--

477
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,700
is exactly what some of the
    British troops did that night,

478
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,500
some 20 minutes
    after the gas release,

479
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,700
believing the attack to be over.

480
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,533
Unbeknownst to the British,

481
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:51,133
the Germans were about to launch
    a second wave of poisonous gas,

482
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:55,933
this time catching
    many soldiers unaware.

483
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:58,800
By the time they got
    their gas hoods back on,

484
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,566
for many, it was too late.

485
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:02,633
The first thing you did,

486
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:04,833
you could deposit
    the contents of your stomach,

487
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:07,133
vomiting into your gas hood.

488
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,300
So your gas hood would be
    half-full of your own vomit,

489
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,566
and maybe the breathing tube

490
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:12,300
would be blocked
    with your own vomit.

491
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,533
It must have been
    absolute hell of earth.

492
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,866
Wearing this,
    fighting for your breath,

493
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:20,433
awful smell inside,
    fear of the gas,

494
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:22,000
fear of the Germans coming.

495
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,233
You then seriously consider
    ripping this from your head,

496
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:29,966
and when you did so,
    you'd be then obviously faced

497
00:26:29,966 --> 00:26:33,666
with the toxic gases
    in their purest form.

498
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:38,033
Some soldiers fought so much
    to get their gas masks off

499
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:40,300
that they tore
    their own throats apart.

500
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,666
Phosgene is not an instant gas.

501
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:50,633
It can take 24 hours
    to come into effect.

502
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:53,833
It's slow, it's insidious,
    it worsens.

503
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,300
You drown on dry land.

504
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,700
You know you are going to die.

505
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,033
A horrible, horrible, painful
    and agonizing way to die.

506
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:10,466
NARRATOR:
    Of the 500 casualties
    of the German gas attack,

507
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:16,800
many are buried here,
    just yards from where they fell.

508
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:25,133
At the dig site,
    Simon Verdegem and the team

509
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:29,133
have uncovered something
    completely unexpected.

510
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:31,500
Here just below the surface

511
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,966
are the remains not of a trench,
    but a tunnel.

512
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:39,266
VERDEGEM:
    The tunnel was completely
    a surprise for us.

513
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:42,300
We didn't know about the
    existence, wasn't on any map,

514
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,433
neither on any
    aerial photographs,

515
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:52,133
so it was actually kind of luck
    that we even found it.

516
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:55,533
NARRATOR:
    The tunnel is a sign
    that the Allied attempt

517
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:57,766
to break the impregnable
    German defenses at Messines

518
00:27:57,766 --> 00:28:01,000
had moved into a much more
    deadly phase.

519
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:09,266
The team removes the roof
    to enter the tunnel

520
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:11,966
for the first time
    since it was abandoned.

521
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:43,500
VERDEGEM: The tunnel is in
    almost perfect condition.

522
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:52,866
The walls, the roof, the floor
    is as it was 100 years ago.

523
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:56,466
You can even see on some points
    the nails sticking out

524
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:58,733
to put some kind of lights
    on there.

525
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:06,133
It's an amazing feeling to be
    able to walk through a tunnel

526
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:08,233
that had been there
    for over 100 years

527
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:11,900
and probably not been entered
    since 1917.

528
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:19,333
These are the roof parts
    from the tunnel behind me.

529
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:22,500
Yeah, they're extremely
    thick pieces of timber,

530
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,066
incredibly good condition.

531
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:26,833
Yeah, it's amazing
    and it's still heavy

532
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,566
so it didn't dry out
    or anything.

533
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,533
Pre-made by the look of it.

534
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:34,633
All pre-made,
    so they all have the same size.

535
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:37,300
They are all as long
    and as wide as the others.

536
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,566
The construction system
    that the Germans have used here

537
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:42,933
to build these tunnels
    is to dig underground.

538
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:44,333
This isn't cut and cover,

539
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,600
they've actually tunneled
    underneath the surface--

540
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,800
in this case,
    part of the battlefield,

541
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,933
part of the road--
    and constructed a tunnel there,

542
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:53,000
which has then been lined

543
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,500
with these prefabricated
    timber sections.

544
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,400
A section to go on the floor,
    two uprights, and then a roof

545
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,400
so it can be put in place
    very quickly.

546
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,400
NARRATOR:
    The sophisticated
    prefabricated tunnel

547
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,866
is evidence of
    a widespread underground war,

548
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:12,600
which reached its peak here
    in Messines in 1917.

549
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:17,800
It was a type of warfare
    the Allies would develop

550
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,100
on a massive scale.

551
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,433
What they were trying to achieve
    by going underground

552
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:24,366
was to blow up the enemy

553
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:26,366
basically to try and destroy
    strong-points.

554
00:30:28,766 --> 00:30:29,833
NARRATOR:
    If the Allies were going

555
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:32,466
to break the deadlock
    of trench warfare

556
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:35,533
they would have to take
    the German strong points.

557
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,233
We're just moving up
    from the British frontline

558
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:42,133
in front of the hills
    of Messines--

559
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,600
this is the Messines ridge.

560
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,333
And as we rise up this slope,
    we can really get the sense

561
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:50,733
of where the Germans were
    sitting at the top of this ridge

562
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:53,700
and they would have been looking
    down upon the British below

563
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,933
and any of the enemy
    that wanted to try and attack

564
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:58,333
these German trenches would have
    to labor up this slope

565
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:02,000
just as we're trying to labor up
    it in a modern car.

566
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,900
NARRATOR:
    So in January 1916,
    the Allies forged a new plan.

567
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:11,033
If they couldn't get across
    no-man's land,

568
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:12,833
they would go beneath it.

569
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,500
They would dig tunnels
    towards key targets

570
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,833
and plant explosives below them.

571
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:22,766
Then, they would simultaneously
    detonate the charges

572
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:25,200
right under the Germans.

573
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,500
It was called
    "earthquaking the ridge."

574
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,866
DOYLE:
    The British were in
    a really good situation

575
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:32,166
because they were in
    the lower ground

576
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,433
and the Germans were in
    the high ground.

577
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:37,300
That meant that for the British,
    all they had to do in effect

578
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,733
was dig in a straight line.

579
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:42,900
And if they could go in
    a shallow tunnel downwards

580
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,966
they could undermine
    the Germans.

581
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:51,200
NARRATOR:
    The plan called for up to
    49 tunnels dug under the ridge,

582
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,400
ending in 25 mines placed
    under the German strongholds.

583
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,233
The British tunnelers--
    called moles--

584
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:02,833
included many ex-coal miners.

585
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,900
All were volunteers,

586
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,366
but because they were
    specialists

587
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:09,433
working at
    an unusually perilous job,

588
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:13,566
they were each paid three times
    more than an ordinary soldier.

589
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:18,433
DOYLE:
    They were using a technique
    called clay-kicking.

590
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:20,433
The man who was doing
    the kicking--

591
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:21,733
that is doing the digging--

592
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,166
would lie back
    on a wooden construction.

593
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,366
He would be starting
    at the base of a face

594
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:29,600
and using a tool called
    a grafting tool,

595
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,133
he would sort of work out
    a clod of earth, clod of clay,

596
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:36,100
which would then be taken away.

597
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,933
And the British used it to great
    effect here in Messines.

598
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:43,766
NARRATOR:
    The tunnelers experimented
    with various charges

599
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:48,066
before settling on a new
    explosive called ammonal--

600
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:52,000
a mix of aluminum powder
    the fuel for the explosion,

601
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,666
and ammonium nitrate,

602
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:58,633
the chemical combustion
    that powers the blast.

603
00:32:58,633 --> 00:33:02,700
Ammonal was three times
    more powerful than gunpowder,

604
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,500
and considerably less volatile.

605
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,633
It could not be set off
    by fire or bullets.

606
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:12,566
Detonators were placed
    in some of the boxes,

607
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:15,333
which were electrically fired
    from back in the trenches.

608
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:19,200
The shockwave
    from the initial explosions

609
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,666
would set off
    the other ammonal charges.

610
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:25,966
The drawback with ammonal

611
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:28,600
was that it degraded
    when it was wet,

612
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,966
so the explosive was sealed
    in rubberized tins and boxes

613
00:33:32,966 --> 00:33:35,200
before being laid
    in vast quantities

614
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,066
at the end of the tunnels.

615
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:51,033
The farm of Petite Douve is just
    500 yards from the dig site.

616
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:53,800
During the war,
    Petite Douve was a stronghold

617
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,566
on the German frontline.

618
00:33:56,566 --> 00:33:59,766
It was also the destination
    for one of the British tunnels,

619
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:05,100
which branched under the farm,
    its ends packed with explosives.

620
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,333
Where I'm stood now
    is on the old German frontline

621
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,699
on the western extremity of the
    Petite Douve strong point.

622
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:14,966
The British frontline
    was 500 meters or so west,

623
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:16,600
just below those farm buildings,

624
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,166
and that's where the British
    started their mine

625
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:21,366
in and among where those
    farm buildings are now

626
00:34:21,366 --> 00:34:24,500
And they would have kicked
    and dug underground

627
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,166
pretty much beneath our feet
    as we are now, 520 meters

628
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,366
for the principle charge

629
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:31,266
just over my left shoulder
    under the strong point.

630
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,400
NARRATOR:
    But here at Petite Douve
    in 1916,

631
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,866
the British tunnelers weren't
    having it all their own way.

632
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,333
The Germans knew
    of the underground plan

633
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:59,166
and were digging
    their own tunnels

634
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,933
in an attempt to kill
    the British miners.

635
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,533
JOHAN VANDEWALLE:
    These are all pieces of bricks
    from the farm.

636
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:07,766
NARRATOR:
    Johan Vandewalle
    is Belgium's leading expert

637
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:10,200
on the underground war.

638
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,033
Oh, I think this is the place.

639
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:12,466
So what have we got
    here then, Johan?

640
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:13,766
What's this,
    is this the shaft?

641
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:15,700
This is the spot.

642
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,333
Literally here is one of the
    German countermining shafts

643
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,300
that goes straight down--
    what, 20 meters?

644
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,233
Exactly.

645
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:24,200
Okay, that's it.

646
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,966
NARRATOR:
    The team is here to explore
    the opening

647
00:35:30,966 --> 00:35:33,800
to the last surviving
    German mineshaft

648
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,733
from the Messines battlefield.

649
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,533
So this is the first time
    that anyone has really--

650
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:40,900
since the war--
    done any work on this,

651
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,933
tried to identify how deep
    it is, what was going on.

652
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,200
It's like an exploration
    into the past isn't it?

653
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,166
Yeah.

654
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:51,266
NARRATOR:
    As the British were tunneling
    towards Petite Douve,

655
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:54,200
the Germans were sinking
    vertical shafts

656
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,500
to get beneath
    the British tunnels,

657
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,866
where they would lay their own
    explosives called camouflets

658
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:05,833
in an attempt to kill or disrupt
    the British working above them.

659
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:09,733
DOYLE:
    Petite Douve is an interesting
    aspect of the Messines battle

660
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:14,433
because here we can see the
    Germans seeking out the British.

661
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:15,733
This is a rare survivor.

662
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:18,833
Really we're not going to get
    this chance again.

663
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:27,200
NARRATOR:
    The German mine shaft
    could be as deep as 25 meters,

664
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,233
but what the team doesn't know
    is whether it will be blocked

665
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:34,700
or if the water will be clear
    enough to actually see anything.

666
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:39,400
DOYLE:
    It's so tantalizing

667
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,900
just to get things
    appearing out of the murk.

668
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:52,333
Yes, what is that?

669
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,366
NARRATOR:
    As the camera descends,

670
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:57,066
from the gloom emerges
    the timber sides

671
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:59,800
of the German mineshaft.

672
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,800
DOYLE:
    We're just seeing the shaft
    as we go down

673
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,666
and we're getting some idea
    of features in the side wall.

674
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,866
It's a real testimony to the men
    who built this

675
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:13,666
that its still here and
    it's still in good condition.

676
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,633
Nobody was before here.

677
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,233
So nobody has ever seen
    this kind of thing,

678
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:21,400
this is the first time anybody's
    ever seen this since 1917.

679
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,200
This is interesting this is
    porcelain for electricity?

680
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,766
MAN:
    Yes.

681
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:29,333
NARRATOR:
    The mineshaft would have had
    electrical lighting,

682
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,733
and pumps to keep the water out.

683
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,300
They also find pipes
    used to take fresh air

684
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,433
to the German miners below.

685
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:42,466
Are we seeing the ladder
    there, do you think?

686
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:45,266
NARRATOR:
    Attached to the wall
    is the steel ladder

687
00:37:45,266 --> 00:37:48,966
used to descend
    to the bottom of the shaft.

688
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:51,733
From there,
    tunnels would lead underneath

689
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:54,333
the British miners close by.

690
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,000
VANDEWALLE:
    Can you imagine a ladder?

691
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,200
With your muddy hands pulling
    down on a steel ladder.

692
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,033
You couldn't really imagine
    descending on that ladder,

693
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:03,133
could you, down to 20 meters.

694
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:04,200
Stop, stop, stop.

695
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,800
Is it possible to turn
    the camera?

696
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,133
NARRATOR:
    As they reach
    the bottom of the shaft,

697
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:11,900
Johan thinks he has found
    something.

698
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,200
So we are on the west side
    now this is the west.

699
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,333
Try to keep this depth,
    but just try to..

700
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,366
DOYLE:
    Gently turning it around
    so that we might...

701
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:30,066
This looks like for me
    the gallery to no-man's land.

702
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:32,266
It is possible
    to come a little bit back?

703
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:38,933
Stop because this is
    to no man's land

704
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:43,866
So this is the direction
    towards the British.

705
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:46,866
NARRATOR:
    This tantalizing glimpse
    into the darkness

706
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:50,533
reveals the entry of the
    German's fighting gallery:

707
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:53,500
an offensive trench dug to try
    and attack the British miners

708
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,266
in this underground war.

709
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,666
The British miners finished
    the main tunnel at Petite Douve

710
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:05,433
in August 1916,

711
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:08,466
placing 25 tons of ammonal
    beneath the farm.

712
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,566
They then set about digging
    a branch tunnel

713
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:22,500
to lay a secondary mine nearby.

714
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,000
But using sensitive
    listening equipment,

715
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,333
the British tunnelers picked up
    the unmistakable sound

716
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:33,166
of German voices
    only yards away.

717
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:34,600
TURNER:
    The British heard them.

718
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,500
This is a blind form of warfare
    digging towards one another

719
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,900
detecting purely by sound.

720
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,766
So the British heard
    they had been detected

721
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:45,866
and blew what's called
    a camouflet, a disruption mine,

722
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:48,066
which was only moderately
    successful,

723
00:39:48,066 --> 00:39:49,466
and of course
    that provoked a response.

724
00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:55,700
NARRATOR:
    The Germans responded
    with their own explosive charge,

725
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,466
claiming the lives
    of at least three tunnelers,

726
00:39:58,466 --> 00:40:03,066
whose bodies still remain
    entombed under the farm.

727
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:06,066
Their names are recorded on the
    Ploegsteert Memorial close by.

728
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,566
Of the 25 mines planned by the
    British under the Messines Ridge

729
00:40:14,566 --> 00:40:18,600
Petite Douve was the only one
    lost to enemy action--

730
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,700
a fact that still
    resonates today.

731
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,966
TURNER:
    The main charge at Petite Douve,
    all 50,000 pounds of it,

732
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:25,500
was never blown,
    it was abandoned.

733
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,333
So it's still lying dormant
    25 meters below ground

734
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,633
very close to where
    we're stood now.

735
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:35,000
NARRATOR:
    The unsettling fact is that
    beneath this small Belgian farm

736
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,933
is potentially the world's
    biggest unexploded bomb.

737
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,833
Earthquaking the Messines Ridge
    with mines

738
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:49,733
was part of a much more
    ambitious plan.

739
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:52,600
British high command believed
    that the key to unlocking

740
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,300
the Western Front
    lay here in Flanders.

741
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,000
Breaking through the line
    at Messines

742
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,266
would be the first part
    of an operation,

743
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:04,233
which they hoped would lead
    to the defeat of Germany.

744
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,300
In his preparation
    for the battle,

745
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,633
the British general
    Sir Herbert Plumer

746
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:12,800
was leaving nothing to chance.

747
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,966
TURNER:
    He pulled in 2,250
    artillery pieces,

748
00:41:17,966 --> 00:41:19,466
which for a seven-day
    bombardment

749
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:22,866
consumed three-and-a-half
    million shells.

750
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:24,266
You had 31,000 people--

751
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:26,300
that's a third
    of the modern British army--

752
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,400
employed solely
    on road building duties.

753
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,700
NARRATOR:
    9,500 motor vehicles
    were amassed.

754
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,200
173 miles of railway were laid.

755
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,033
Plumer would have more aircraft
    over Messines

756
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:45,500
than the Germans had
    over the entire Western Front.

757
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:53,733
And the days of horses
    leading the attack were over.

758
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,333
Tanks had been first used
    in the autumn of 1916

759
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:01,166
with limited success.

760
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:02,433
(loud explosion)

761
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:06,333
Early versions had been slow,
    unreliable, and unbearably hot

762
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:09,133
for the crew who operated them.

763
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:11,600
For the impending battle
    of Messines,

764
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,766
Plumer took delivery of 72 of
    the latest model: The Mark IV.

765
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:22,733
CHURCHILL:
    This was the one that the tank
    drivers had been waiting for.

766
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:23,800
There were bits of it
    they really liked.

767
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,966
I think they liked that
    they'd moved the fuel tank

768
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:27,900
away from the drivers,

769
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,133
which obviously if you're
    under shellfire is beneficial.

770
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,700
They've taken those stabilizers
    off the back.

771
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,066
These little wheels
    on the back of the tank,

772
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:37,266
which were supposed
    to help steer it,

773
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:41,333
but really they were just
    getting caught in everything.

774
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:44,333
NARRATOR:
    Although impervious
    to small arms fire,

775
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,200
they were vulnerable
    to artillery

776
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,533
and were prone to catching fire.

777
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,066
And there were
    other shortcomings.

778
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:54,000
They were hoping that when
    the Mark IV came out,

779
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,800
it would just be one driver
    required to driver it.

780
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,400
But actually it was four.

781
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,266
And it was done through this
    sort of insane system

782
00:43:01,266 --> 00:43:03,733
of banging on the engine casing
    and hand signals

783
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:04,866
to try and steer the thing.

784
00:43:04,866 --> 00:43:08,400
And it took four men to get it
    across a battlefield.

785
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,933
NARRATOR:
    The Mark IV was a heavily
    armored vehicle

786
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:12,500
designed to plough through

787
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,166
the previously impenetrable
    belts of barbed wire

788
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:18,433
while protecting the infantry
    following closely behind.

789
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,233
While rudimentary,
    the tank offered a way

790
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:28,300
of punching through
    the German defenses.

791
00:43:33,933 --> 00:43:37,466
Below the town,
    the dig offers a grim memento

792
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:40,400
of the bitter fighting to come:

793
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,133
the helmet of a German soldier,

794
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:47,666
and nearby, an ammunition box

795
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,600
containing the belt of
    a British Vickers machine gun.

796
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:56,366
The Vickers gun
    was built on the success

797
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:58,000
of the earlier Maxim gun.

798
00:44:00,466 --> 00:44:02,200
As well as being lighter,

799
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,633
it featured
    a new muzzle booster,

800
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:07,833
a cup at the end of the barrel.

801
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:11,000
This captured some of the
    exploding gas from each shot

802
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,133
and pushed the sliding barrel
    backwards,

803
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:17,266
adding to the energy of the
    recoil that powered the gun,

804
00:44:17,266 --> 00:44:20,333
making it less likely
    to malfunction.

805
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:24,833
But it was the big guns--

806
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:26,466
(loud explosion)

807
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:29,400
heavy artillery that began
    General Plumer's battle

808
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,933
to take the German bunkers
    and strong points

809
00:44:31,933 --> 00:44:35,866
on the Messines Ridge
    in the summer of 1917.

810
00:44:38,966 --> 00:44:42,200
On the evening of June 6,
    Allied soldiers assembled

811
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,700
on the low ground
    beneath the ridge.

812
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,033
The mines containing over
    a million pounds of explosives

813
00:44:50,033 --> 00:44:52,066
were now ready
    under the German strong points.

814
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,033
Still fearful that the Germans
    might discover them,

815
00:44:58,033 --> 00:45:01,800
the tunnelers prepared for their
    simultaneous detonation

816
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,033
in the final few hours.

817
00:45:10,433 --> 00:45:13,233
TURNER:
    The troops moved into position,
    in darkness

818
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:16,333
quietly as possible into
    taped positions in the open.

819
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,000
They were told to lie
    in the open and wait.

820
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,266
And waiting like that
    is a nightmare,

821
00:45:23,266 --> 00:45:25,433
it's interminable.

822
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:27,433
Troops just want
    the attack to happen.

823
00:45:29,566 --> 00:45:33,133
And they lay down in the open
    on their tapes waiting to go

824
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:36,100
resting, head on the forearms
    with the helmet,

825
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,666
dozing, and imprisoned really
    by their thoughts.

826
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:44,566
NARRATOR:
    The moon came out at midnight,

827
00:45:44,566 --> 00:45:47,933
and it was said that in
    Wytschaete Wood near Messines,

828
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:51,033
nightingales could be heard
    singing.

829
00:45:51,033 --> 00:45:52,933
(birds chirping)

830
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:57,833
The tunnelers checked
    their watches

831
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:00,133
and the leads to the explosives.

832
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:04,766
At ten past 3:00 that morning,

833
00:46:04,766 --> 00:46:07,200
19 mines
    under the Messines Ridge

834
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,433
were simultaneously detonated.

835
00:46:10,066 --> 00:46:13,066
(loud explosion)

836
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:24,400
TURNER: The troops would have
    been presented by the blast

837
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,633
where I'm standing now,

838
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:27,933
which was the height
    of St Paul's Cathedral

839
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:31,433
rearing right up above them--
    these huge tongues of flame

840
00:46:31,433 --> 00:46:33,300
and incredible clods of earth

841
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,833
the size of carts,
    huge lumps, raining down.

842
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,600
The commanding officers
    and the company commanders

843
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,533
would have said, "Right lads,
    we're off, let's go.

844
00:46:40,533 --> 00:46:41,566
Get up everybody, get up."

845
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:43,500
And they would have
    advanced up the hill,

846
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,700
marching into this inferno.

847
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:49,000
The Germans on the ridge--

848
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,533
if they haven't been
    obliterated by this blast--

849
00:46:51,533 --> 00:46:52,600
they rush into position.

850
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,033
As soon as they get into
    their fighting positions,

851
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:59,633
they're just... just raining of
    shells coming down.

852
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:02,566
They talk about the fact that
    they were "virtually deafened,

853
00:47:02,566 --> 00:47:04,200
useless,
    indifferent to their fate,"

854
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,300
one German officer describes it.

855
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,700
NARRATOR:
    Detonating the mines
    on the Messines Ridge

856
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:17,133
created the biggest explosion
    the world had ever seen.

857
00:47:18,466 --> 00:47:21,900
Some estimates say
    10,000 German soldiers

858
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,200
were killed in the blasts.

859
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:30,666
From the moment
    the mines detonated,

860
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:33,333
it would take New Zealand troops
    just over an hour

861
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:36,300
to reach the outskirts
    of Messines.

862
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,933
By the end of the day,

863
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:40,933
the Allies had achieved
    all their objectives.

864
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,800
General Plumer was delighted

865
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,866
with how low the casualties had
    been in the initial offensive,

866
00:47:53,866 --> 00:47:58,266
although by the end of the
    battle seven days later,

867
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:02,766
24,000 Allied soldiers had been
    killed, wounded or were missing.

868
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,000
The German casualty figure
    was as much as a third higher.

869
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,866
But after nearly three years
    at Messines,

870
00:48:14,866 --> 00:48:20,433
Plumer had broken the deadlock
    of trench warfare.

871
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:23,166
DOYLE:
    The Battle of Messines
    has got to be considered

872
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,000
as one of the most
    successful battles

873
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,466
the British army ever fought.

874
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:31,266
The combination of the mine
    warfare, the artillery assault,

875
00:48:31,266 --> 00:48:34,600
and the infantry assault
    makes this battle unique

876
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,466
and makes it--
    in my opinion anyway--

877
00:48:37,466 --> 00:48:40,000
the most successful
    of the British army's activity

878
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,266
on the Western Front.

879
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:51,100
NARRATOR:
    In Flanders,
    nearly a century later,

880
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,866
the craters from the detonated
    mines are still clearly visible.

881
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:01,700
They stand as a reminder
    of General Plumer's bold plan

882
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:06,833
to drive the Germans
    from the Messines Ridge.

883
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,533
TURNER:
    It was a stellar achievement

884
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:11,566
to breach such an
    impregnable objective,

885
00:49:11,566 --> 00:49:13,433
but it was unrepeatable,

886
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:15,633
and its planners never envisaged
    that it would

887
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:19,733
bounce straight into some kind
    of incredible breakthrough--

888
00:49:19,733 --> 00:49:21,833
troops flooding across
    the Northern plains

889
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,733
and on to Berlin.

890
00:49:23,733 --> 00:49:26,933
NARRATOR:
    In fact, the Allies advanced
    barely ten miles

891
00:49:26,933 --> 00:49:30,033
into German territory
    before faltering.

892
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,566
The three-and-a-half million
    shells fired

893
00:49:32,566 --> 00:49:34,100
during the Messines offensive

894
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,733
had not only destroyed
    enemy trenches,

895
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:39,166
but had churned up
    the ground ahead,

896
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:42,566
making it all but impassable.

897
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:45,666
Now one of the grimmest
    campais of the war,

898
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:46,900
Passchendaele,

899
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:52,233
would claim over half a million
    casualties in a sea of mud.

900
00:49:52,233 --> 00:49:57,366
The long awaited breakthrough
    had failed to materialize.

901
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:04,700
Messines may have fallen,
    but it would take another year

902
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,500
of bitter fighting
    before the war was over

903
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,100
and the armistice signed.

904
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:22,400
CHURCHILL: When we look at World
    War I, we spend a lot of time

905
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,766
concentrating on the people
    that died in the war

906
00:50:24,766 --> 00:50:27,466
and we don't often think
    of the people they left behind.

907
00:50:27,466 --> 00:50:31,066
One story that's really touched
    me is the story of two friends

908
00:50:31,066 --> 00:50:33,733
named Robert Irvine
    and John Corrie

909
00:50:33,733 --> 00:50:35,066
from a small town
    in Dumfriesshire

910
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:37,200
who served together
    throughout the war.

911
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,633
John was actually killed near
    here in the Battle of Messines.

912
00:50:46,433 --> 00:50:48,433
After the battle,
    a New Zealand soldier

913
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:50,633
was walking back
    across the battlefield,

914
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:54,066
and he actually found a diary
    lying on the ground.

915
00:50:54,066 --> 00:50:55,733
And when he opened it up
    and went through it,

916
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:58,066
he saw that there were
    a number of letters, and photos,

917
00:50:58,066 --> 00:50:59,733
and personal mementos

918
00:50:59,733 --> 00:51:01,566
and he saw it belonged
    to John Corrie,

919
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:03,300
and he thought it would be
    the right thing to do

920
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:08,466
if he sent it back to Lizzie,
    John's sweetheart.

921
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:10,733
Lizzie came to Belgium
    after the First World War

922
00:51:10,733 --> 00:51:13,566
to visit John's grave.

923
00:51:17,766 --> 00:51:20,266
She never married,
    and when she eventually died

924
00:51:20,266 --> 00:51:22,400
aged nearly 100 in 1991,

925
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,400
she was buried with a photograph
    of him in her hand.

926
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:42,600
NARRATOR:
    Although the Germans
    had been driven out

927
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,200
of their trenches at Messines,

928
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,766
it would take
    the arrival of American troops

929
00:51:47,766 --> 00:51:50,533
joining the Allies
    to finally bring Germany

930
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:54,766
to its knees and end the war.

931
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:03,266
The archaeological dig
    has unlocked

932
00:52:03,266 --> 00:52:05,866
a hundred-year-old time capsule
    of the First World War.

933
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,233
The horses and trenchehe

934
00:52:12,233 --> 00:52:15,066
the bombs and the bullets,

935
00:52:15,066 --> 00:52:16,466
and the underground tunnels

936
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:20,200
snaking beneath the killing
    fields of Flanders

937
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,833
all tell of a war
    of huge technological change.

938
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,666
(explosion)

939
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:29,600
But above all,
    the dig is a timely reminder

940
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,500
of the human sacrifice

941
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,766
that more than anything else
    has come to symbolize

942
00:52:34,766 --> 00:52:37,633
the horrors
    of the First World War.
